= Deploying StarkNet contracts

In this section we will we deploy our voting smart contract. However, to understand the deployment procedure in StarkNet, we need first to understand the relevance of Sequencers for decentralization and the part the Universal Deployer Contract plays in maintaining StarkNet security.

== Deploying I: Argent's User Interface

StarkWare made the conscious decision to subsidize the usage of Starknet while the network was being developed.
After battle testing the technology stack, the focus is on decentralizing the network.
Decentralization means that the subsidy to deploy contracts must stop because who would want to run a Sequencer if they won't get paid for deploying smart contracts?
Sequencers are Starknet nodes that execute the Starknet OS program, prove the results, and update the Starknet state.
They're vital for StarkNet's security. Notice that if there were no fees, it would mean either one of two things: (1) the network is centralized or (2) the Sequencers run like a loss-making charity (https://www.argent.xyz/blog/understanding-the-universal-deployer-contract/[Darlington, 2022]).

Before deploying our contract, we need to `declare` it: calculate the class hash.
Unlike Ethereum, Starknet distinguishes between a contract class and a contract instance.
A contract class represents the code of a contract (but with no state), while a contract instance represents a specific instance of the class, with its own state.
In other words, two exactly equal contracts will have the same contract class hash but, once deployed, they will be different contract instances.

Argent's User Interface (UI) lets us declare and deploy our contract quickly.
What comes next is entirely inspired by https://www.argent.xyz/blog/understanding-the-universal-deployer-contract/[Darlington's post in Argent's blog] and will quote it heavily.
These are the steps:

. Open your Argent wallet and click on the settings icon at the top right.
. Select "`Developer settings`".
. Select "`Smart contract development`".
. Declare your contract to get the clash hash: select "Declare smart contract".
. Select "`Click to upload contract JSON`" to upload the JSON ABI, `voting_compiled.json`, obtained from compiling our contract.
Then select the network the contract will be deployed on and the account used for deployment (who pays for the deployment?).
Sign the transaction.

image::argent1.png[argent1]

. We get redirected to the page with our contract's class hash.
In this case, our class hash is: `0x0679eec449818394722a31ecb38594343b2c687efab5404a3f75fd45d4c1fa0c`.

image::argent2.png[argent2]

. To deploy our contract, we select the "Deploy smart contract" option in the "Smart contract deployment" section.
We need to input our constructor's class hash and call data.

The value for salt can be any number you want;
it's there only to introduce randomness into the generated address for your soon-to-be-deployed smart contract.

The unique field, combined with salt, can get the same address on different networks.
For example, if we deploy to Goerli, passing the value 5 for salt, and do not check the unique address field, the smart contract will be deployed to a specific address;
let's say it's 0xabc...
We can now repeat the deployment process, but this time on Mainnet, and if we pass the same values for salt and the unique field, the smart contract will be deployed to the same address 0xabc...
but this time on Mainnet.
In this example, we will uncheck the unique field and write 0 in salt for simplicity, not because we want to preserve the address.

Unfortunately, until December 2022, Argent still needs to add the feature to deal with arrays in their UI deployer.
This will change soon, but we can not deploy our voting contract using Argent's UI yet.
We will deploy it using the `starknet cli` in the section.

. Sign the transaction, and you'll be redirected to a page with your deployed contract address

Our contract is now on-chain.
We can interact with it using block explorers such as https://testnet.starkscan.co/[StarkScan] or https://goerli.voyager.online/[Voyager].
These explorers have plenty of functionality.
Some of the most used sections are the `read` and `write` tabs of a contract;
here, you can interact with the `view` and `external` functions in your contract.

== Deploying II: Open Zeppelin's Universal Deployer Contract

This section will explain what is underneath the Argent's UI.
Do this section if you want to get deeper into what deploying a contract in Starknet means.
This will help you later work with more complex contracts, e.g.
deploying your customize account contracts.
However, for most contracts, using Argent's UI will be enough.

For deploying our contracts, we need the `deploy syscall`.
The https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo-lang/blob/master/src/starkware/starknet/common/syscalls.cairo#L157[deploy syscall is a function] available to any Cairo smart contract that allows the Sequencer to get paid proportionally to the complexity of the deployment.

Within a contract, we can import this function from the starknet library that comes as part of the `cairo-lang` package.

----
from starkware.starknet.common.syscalls import deploy
----

This new way of deploying a smart contract means we need a "`deployer`" contract that uses the syscall to deploy any smart contract we create.
This creates a new challenge in the form of a tongue twister: How do you deploy a deployer without using the deploy transaction?

The folks at Open Zeppelin have been aware of the need to have a deployer smart contract that is generic enough that can be used by anyone wanting to deploy their smart contracts.
They've called it the https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/cairo-contracts/blob/main/src/openzeppelin/utils/presets/UniversalDeployer.cairo[Universal Deployer Contract (UDC)], which has a single function, `deployContract`.

[,cairo]
----
from starkware.starknet.common.syscalls import deploy
...

@event
func ContractDeployed(...) {}

@external
func deployContract{...}(
    classHash: felt,
    salt: felt,
    unique: felt,
    calldata_len: felt,
    calldata: felt*
) -> (address: felt) {
    ...
    let (address) = deploy(
        class_hash=classHash,
        contract_address_salt=_salt,
        constructor_calldata_size=calldata_len,
        constructor_calldata=calldata,
        deploy_from_zero=from_zero,
    );

    ContractDeployed.emit(...);

    return (address=address);
}
----

The public function is a wrapper around the deploy syscall that also emits an event when it has finished deploying a contract.

The UDC is already available on Goerli and Mainnet using the https://testnet.starkscan.co/contract/0x041a78e741e5af2fec34b695679bc6891742439f7afb8484ecd7766661ad02bf#class[same address], so it's available as a public good for the Starknet ecosystem.

To deploy your contract using the UDC, you should now perform these steps:

. Deploy an account if you do not have one already.
. Compile your contract.
. Declare your contract class on your target network (Goerli or Mainnet) and take note of the returned class hash.
Before this, you need to deploy a new account.
. Invoke the function `deployContract` of the UDC on either Goerli or Mainnet, passing the class hash of your contract and the constructor arguments, among other parameters.

Notice that a "deploy" transaction is never used;
instead, the invoke transaction is used.
The invoke transaction requires a user account (wallet) with enough wrapped Ether to charge the user for the deployment.

The process looks like this:

image::udc.jpeg[udc]

Before deploying our contract, we need to define the account contract that will pay for the deployment.
Using the `starknet` CLI, we can define a new wallet with `new_account`.
Using the '--account' flag, we can name the wallet with an alias.
We can use the alias to refer to the account in later commands;
in the example below, we call it `voting-contract`.
With the `--wallet` flag, we can indicate the wallet format we will use for our account contract.
Since we are using Account Abstraction, account contracts are programable (not just a fixed EOA as with the L1).
That is, we can give customized functionality to our account contract.
In this case, we are using the standard Open Zeppelin (modified by Starkware) account contract: `starkware.starknet.wallets.open_zeppelin.OpenZeppelinAccount`.
Before, when we were using the Argent UI, we implicitly decided that we would use the Argent's account contract with its functionality and features, which differs from Open Zeppelin's.
We will learn more about account contracts and how to customize them in Camp 3.
This is one of the most powerful features in StarkNet and is the catalyst to get a Web2-level User Experience (UX).

[,Bash]
----
starknet new_account \
    --network alpha-goerli \
    --account voting-contract \
    --wallet starkware.starknet.wallets.open_zeppelin.OpenZeppelinAccount
----

The `new_account` command did not deploy the account contract;
it simply calculated its address and public key:

[,Bash]
----
Account address: 0x00f20c6664cc47e569abe53c7ba19f04685158a1b2f01c9a923cd3849354a928
Public key: 0x01dadfed69928d423a4328ca1a4cd9b375a5911bb810fd2af9f5cd4ec914aec5
Move the appropriate amount of funds to the account and then deploy the account
by invoking the 'starknet deploy_account' command.

Note: This is a modified version of the OpenZeppelin account contract. The signature is computed
differently.
----

Before deploying this account contract, we need to fund it so it can pay for its deployment (this process is called counterfactual deployment and will be studied in Camp 3).
We can go back to the https://faucet.goerli.starknet.io/[StarkNet Goerli Faucet] and feed it with the address we got from `new_account`: `0x00f20c6664cc47e569abe53c7ba19f04685158a1b2f01c9a923cd3849354a928`.
We wait a couple of minutes, and then we can deploy our account contract:

[,Bash]
----
starknet deploy_account \
    --network alpha-goerli \
    --account voting-contract \
    --wallet starkware.starknet.wallets.open_zeppelin.OpenZeppelinAccount
----

We get:

[,Bash]
----
Sending the transaction with max_fee: 0.000030 ETH (29901030096714 WEI).
Sent deploy account contract transaction.

Contract address: 0x00f20c6664cc47e569abe53c7ba19f04685158a1b2f01c9a923cd3849354a928
Transaction hash: 0x60bfafca95e0bb37cfd1b310bdaa4c35790c32ba1e429a30c40fea270ddc86b
----

Great, we now have deployed an account contract.
When we create an account using Argent or Braavos, this is what is happening beneath;
however, they deploy their customized account contracts.
In Camp 3, we will learn how to create customized account contracts.

Let's deploy our voting contract.
The following steps will be similar to what we saw in Argent's UI.
First, we declare the contract.
With the `--account` flag, we indicate that the `voting-contract` account will pay for the deployment of our voting contract.
When using Argent's UI, we paid with our Argent account.

[,Bash]
----
starknet declare \
    --contract contracts/cairo/voting_compiled.json \
    --network alpha-goerli \
    --account voting-contract \
    --wallet starkware.starknet.wallets.open_zeppelin.OpenZeppelinAccount
----

We get:

[,Bash]
----
Sending the transaction with max_fee: 0.000000 ETH (56338158598 WEI).
Declare transaction was sent.
Contract class hash: 0x679eec449818394722a31ecb38594343b2c687efab5404a3f75fd45d4c1fa0c
Transaction hash: 0x393640424903875ff11875e1cd19b0c06bac63be4823c3ad00edd7a79d7ecd
----

Want to see something fun?
Compare this contract class hash with the one we got using Argent's UI, and you will see it is the same.
In Camp 3, we will get deeper into what defines a class hash.

Let's deploy our contract by invoking the `deployContract` in the UDC.
The `invoke` command calls a function from a deployed contract.
We need to feed it the address of the contract we will call, its abi in JSON format (you can find it in the block explorers, in the Starknet Book you can find it in link:starknetbook/camp_1/contracts/cairo/UDC_abi.json[starknetbook/camp_1/contracts/cairo/UDC_abi.json]), the name of the function we are calling, and any input (calldata) the function needs.

Since the UDC is nothing more than a deployed contract, we can see and interact with in any https://testnet.starkscan.co/contract/0x041a78e741e5af2fec34b695679bc6891742439f7afb8484ecd7766661ad02bf[block explorer];
from there we can download its ABI in JSON format.
Its address is `0x041a78e741e5af2fec34b695679bc6891742439f7afb8484ecd7766661ad02bf`.
The function we will call is `deployContract` which asks for the following call data:

[,cairo]
----
@external
func deployContract{...}(
    classHash: felt,
    salt: felt,
    unique: felt,
    calldata_len: felt,
    calldata: felt*
) -> (address: felt) {...}
----

How would or call data would look?

* classHash = `0x679eec449818394722a31ecb38594343b2c687efab5404a3f75fd45d4c1fa0c`.
* salt = `0`.
* unique = `0`.
This is equivalent to not activating the unique address field in Argent's UI.
* calldata_len = `3`.
Because our voting contract has three parameters (the call data).
* calldata = `<admin_address> <registered_addresses_len> <registered_addresses>`.
With toy data, it could be `111 2 222 333`.
Where `111` is the admin address, `2` is the number of registered addresses, and `222 333` are the two registered addresses, the array.

Before sending another transaction to the network, ensure the previous transaction (declare) is at least in the "`Pending`" state;
otherwise, the second transaction will fail due to an incorrect nonce value.
This happens because the network tracks the current nonce value of each user account, and using the CLI, this value is updated only after a transaction has entered the Pending state.

Here we are using dummy values.
However, you can nicely add your address as the admin of the contract and invite your DAO to vote on-chain with low costs.

The contract address returned by the command is *not* the address of the smart contract you are trying to deploy.
Transactions are asynchronous, and they communicate to you emitting events captured as part of the transaction logs.
If we explore the events of our transaction (link:0x604c27ddd55572175c3da659f1ad773a009a4d30f274275f81be11da644b8a9[0x604c...]) we can see the `ContractDeployed` event:

image::starkscan1.png[starkscan1]

Click on the `details` button:

image::starkscan2.png[starkscan2]

According to the event, the address of our smart contract is https://testnet.starkscan.co/contract/0x0032121d8ae3928188be63faf494b8be3a5d065c5f28c9e75996eac8d3e698c1#overview[0x0032121d8ae3928188be63faf494b8be3a5d065c5f28c9e75996eac8d3e698c1].
We can already play with our contract's `view` and `external` functions by inspecting the "`Read Contract`" and `"Write Contract`" tabs, respectively.

At this point we can attend any hackathon and create our own L2 programs. We are just getting started!
