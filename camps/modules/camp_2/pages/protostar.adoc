= Protostar

https://github.com/software-mansion/protostar[Protostar] is a tool inspired by https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry[Foundry] and key to compile, test and deploy. Its use is recommended by most of the Starknet community.

== Installing Protostar

At this point, we already have `cairo-lang` installed.

On Ubuntu or macOS (not available for Windows), run the following command:

[,Bash]
----
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/software-mansion/protostar/master/install.sh | bash
----

Restart your terminal and run `protostar -v` to see the version of your `protostar` and `cairo-lang`.

If you later want to upgrade your protostar, use `protostar upgrade`. If you run into installation problems, I recommend reviewing the https://docs.swmansion.com/protostar/docs/tutorials/installation[Protostar documentation].
