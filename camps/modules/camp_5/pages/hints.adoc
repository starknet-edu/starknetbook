Python code can be invoked with the %{ %} block called a hint, which is executed right before the next Cairo instruction.
The hint can interact with the program's variables/memory as shown in the following code sample.
Note that the hint is not actually part of the Cairo program, and can thus be replaced by a malicious prover.
We can run a Cairo program with the --program_input flag, which allows providing a json input file that can be referenced inside a hint (https://starknet.io/docs/reference/syntax.html#hints[Cairo documentation]).

[,Rust]
----
alloc_locals;
%{ memory[ap] = 100 %}  // Assign to memory.
[ap] = [ap], ap++;  // Increment `ap` after using it in the hint.
assert [ap - 1] = 100;  // Assert the value has some property.

local a;
let b = 7;
%{
    # Assigns the value '9' to the local variable 'a'.
    ids.a = 3 ** 2
    c = ids.b * 2  # Read a reference inside a hint.
%}

Note that you can access the address of a pointer to a struct using ids.struct_ptr.address_ and you can use memory[addr] for the value of the memory cell at address addr.
