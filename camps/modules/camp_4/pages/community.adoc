= Building Community

It's all about relationships and the goal is to focus on the builders, not what is being built.
Your objective is to plant the seed and let it grow: - Involve community members early - Lets them take the lead, even if they do things differently - Focus on builders and not investors - Make concrete call to actions

== Organizing Meetups

Organizing a meetup is surprisingly time consuming you'll probably have to do the first one on your own.
Call for volunteers at the beginning at the end.
When growing this group, ask for suggestions and ideas openly.
When decisions drag on, step in to move the ball forward.
Steps: - Register on meetup.com: ask us to create a group so you don't have to pay - Pick a date(2-3 weeks in advance) - Tweet about it, and we'll relay - Find a venue, check equipment, plan for food and drinks - Define Program - 3 talks, 15-20min each - We can present remotely if you want - We can connect you to local builders, or fly some to present!
- We'll send you swag - We sponsor meetups with 1k USD to cover costs, ask for it

== Running Workshop

Send a survey after your first meetup, with a form asking if people are interested in technical workshops.
Types of workshops - 0 to 1 - Thematic (ERC20, ERC721) Define Program (2-3h): - Introduction 20-30mn - Then people work - Co education is a great tool - Have people work in pair, 2 behind a single screen - If a question is recurrent, say "`ask these girls they solved it`" - Follow our repo to check new workshops - Try to do them once before - If you are looking for a specific theme, ask us - Better yet, write your own #### Sources [<https://community.starknet.io/t/starknet-decentralization-kicking-off-the-discussion/711>]
