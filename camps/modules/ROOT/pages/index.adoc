The Starknet Book can be improved and will evolve as StarkNet matures.
Together we are setting up the Starknet Book, so there are several sections within the Camps that require Camper input. Camper, your contributions are welcome and needed!
Go to the section https://github.com/starknet-edu/starknetbook/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md[Contributing].
Here are things you can do to help:

* At the beginning of some sections there is a message for Campers who want to collaborate with content.
* Empty section in a camp? Go for it!
* Do you think the Starknet Book needs an additional section? Propose it.
* Can a section be improved? Feel free to modify it.
* Do you want to add an alternative programming language for the examples? Yes please.
* Correct the bugs if you find any.
* Please add an explanation in the exercise comments if you feel they need them.
* Add exercises that show your favorite feature of Cairo.
