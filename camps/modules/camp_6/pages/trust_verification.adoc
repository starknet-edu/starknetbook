= Trust vs. Verification

The goal of these proof systems is to prove `computational integrity` to a verifier.
Computational Integrity can be formalized as follow:

*_Statement of Computational Integrity = (S0, P, T, S1)_*

`S0`: Initial State `P`: Program that changes state `T`: Number of steps `S1`: Final State
