== Modular Arithmetic

A system of arithmetic for integers where numbers "wrap around" when reaching a certain value (aka 'modulus')

A real-world example of modular arithmetic is time-keeping via a clock.
When the hour of the day exceed the modulus(12) we "wrap" around and begin at zero.

Example:

== Finite Fields

Much of today's practical cryptography is based on `finite fields`. A finite field is a field that contains a finite number of elements and defines arithmetic operations for multiplication, addition, subtraction, and divsion. These arithmetic operations are.

A finite field cannot contain sub-fields and therefore typically implements the principles of modular arithmetic over a large, irreducible prime number. The number of elements in the field is also known as its `order`.
