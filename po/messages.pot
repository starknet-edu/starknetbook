"Historically, societal roles like currency, property rights, and social "

"1. **Public Protocol:** The foundation of a Blockchain rests upon a protocol "

"adoption.\n"
"2. **Open P2P Network:** Instead of relying on a centralized entity, a "
"Blockchain operates over a peer-to-peer (P2P) network. This decentralized "
"approach ensures that operations are distributed across various participants "
"or nodes, making the system more resilient to failures and censorship.\n"
"3. **Value Distribution:** Central to the Blockchain's operation is the way "
"it rewards its operators. The system autonomously distributes value in a "

"- **Lasting Broadness.** Starknet continuously resists power consolidation. "

"\n"
"  - Broad power distribution underpins Starknet's legitimacy and must "
"persist across operations and decision-making. While centralized operation "
"may be necessary at times, it should be short-lived.\n"
"  - Starknet's protocol and governance should always be open and "

"- **Neutrality.** Starknet remains impartial to the societal functions it "
"supports.\n"
"\n"
"  - The objectives and ethos of functions on Starknet lie with their "
"creators.\n"
"  - **Censorship resistance:** Starknet remains agnostic to the nature and "

msgstr ""

#: src/ch03-03-provers.md:135
msgid ""
"1.  **Gateway**: Cairo jobs enter SHARP through the gateway.\n"
"\n"
"2.  **Job Creator**: It prevents job duplication and ensures that the\n"
"    system operates consistently, regardless of multiple identical\n"
"    requests.\n"
"\n"
"3.  **Validator**: This is the first important step. The validator\n"
"    service runs validation checks on each job, ensuring they meet the\n"
"    requirements and can fit within the prover machines. Invalid jobs\n"
"    are tagged as such and do not proceed to the Prover.\n"
"\n"
"4.  **Scheduler**: The scheduler service creates \"trains\" that aggregate\n"
"    jobs and send them to the Prover. Recursive jobs are paired and sent\n"
"    to the Prover together.\n"
"\n"
"5.  **Cairo Runner**: This service runs Cairo for the Prover’s needs.\n"
"    The Cairo Runner service runs Cairo programs, executing the\n"
"    necessary computations and generating the execution trace as an\n"
"    intermediate result. The Prover then uses this execution trace.\n"
"\n"
"6.  **Prover**: The Prover computes the proofs for each train (that\n"
"    contains a few jobs).\n"
"\n"
"7.  **Dispatcher**: The Dispatcher serves two functions in the SHARP\n"
"    system.\n"
"\n"
"    1.  In the case of a recursive proof, the Dispatcher runs the Cairo\n"
"        Verifier program on the proof it has received from the Prover,\n"
"        resulting in a new Cairo job that goes back to the Validator.\n"
"\n"
"    2.  In the case of a proof that needs to go on chain (e.g., to\n"
"        Ethereum), the Dispatcher creates \"packages\" from the proof,\n"
"        which can then be sent to the Blockchain Writer.\n"
"\n"
"8.  **Blockchain Writer**: Once the packages have been created by the\n"
"    Dispatcher, they are sent to the Blockchain Writer. The Blockchain\n"
"    Writer is responsible for sending the packages to the appropriate\n"
"    blockchain (e.g., Ethereum) for verification. This is an important\n"
"    step in the SHARP system, as it ensures that the proofs are properly\n"
"    verified and that the transactions are securely recorded on the\n"
"    blockchain.\n"
"\n"
"9.  **Catcher**: The Catcher monitors blockchain (e.g., Ethereum)\n"
"    transactions to ensure that they have been accepted. While the\n"
"    Catcher is relevant for internal monitoring purposes, it is\n"
"    important to note that if a transaction fails, the fact won’t be\n"

#: src/ch03-05-layer-3.md:45

"- **Quick Iteration**: App chains enable rapid protocol changes,\n"
"  freeing you from the constraints of the public Layer 2 roadmap. For\n"

"  your user base.\n"
"\n"
"- **Governance Independence**: You maintain complete control over\n"
"  feature development and improvements, avoiding the need for\n"
"  decentralized governance consensus. This enables, for example, quick\n"
"  implementation of user-suggested features.\n"
"\n"
"- **Cost Efficiency**: Layer 3 offers substantial cost reductions,\n"
"  potentially up to 1 million times compared to Layer 1, making it\n"
"  economically feasible to run more complex applications.\n"
"\n"
"- **Security**: While there may be some trade-offs, such as reduced\n"
"  censorship resistance, the core security mechanisms remain strong.\n"
"\n"
"- **Congestion Avoidance**: App chains are shielded from network\n"
"  congestion, providing a more stable transaction environment, crucial\n"
"  for real-time applications like gaming.\n"
"\n"
"- **Privacy Enhancements**: Layer 3 can serve as a testing ground for\n"
"  privacy-centric features, which could include anonymous transactions\n"
"  or encrypted messaging services.\n"
"\n"
"- **Innovation Platform**: App chains act as experimental fields where\n"

"  serve as a testbed for new consensus algorithms before these are\n"
"  considered for Layer 2."
