"Historically, societal roles like currency, property rights, and social status titles have been governed by *protocols* and *registries*. Their value "

msgstr ""

"1. **Public Protocol:** The foundation of a Blockchain rests upon a protocol that is openly available. This transparency ensures that any interested "

"2. **Open P2P Network:** Instead of relying on a centralized entity, a Blockchain operates over a peer-to-peer (P2P) network. This decentralized approach "
"ensures that operations are distributed across various participants or nodes, making the system more resilient to failures and censorship.\n"
"3. **Value Distribution:** Central to the Blockchain's operation is the way it rewards its operators. The system autonomously distributes value in a "

"broader societal consensus."

"- **Lasting Broadness.** Starknet continuously resists power consolidation. Key points include:\n"
"    - Broad power distribution underpins Starknet's legitimacy and must persist across operations and decision-making. While centralized operation may be "

"    - Starknet's protocol and governance should always be open and transparent.\n"

"- **Neutrality.** Starknet remains impartial to the societal functions it supports.\n"
"    - The objectives and ethos of functions on Starknet lie with their creators.\n"
"    - **Censorship resistance:** Starknet remains agnostic to the nature and meaning of user transactions.\n"

"1.  **Gateway**: Cairo jobs enter SHARP through the gateway.\n"

"    requests.\n"

"3.  **Validator**: This is the first important step. The validator\n"

"    requirements and can fit within the prover machines. Invalid jobs\n"
"    are tagged as such and do not proceed to the Prover.\n"

"4.  **Scheduler**: The scheduler service creates \"trains\" that aggregate\n"
"    jobs and send them to the Prover. Recursive jobs are paired and sent\n"
"    to the Prover together.\n"
"\n"
"5.  **Cairo Runner**: This service runs Cairo for the Prover’s needs.\n"
"    The Cairo Runner service runs Cairo programs, executing the\n"
"    necessary computations and generating the execution trace as an\n"
"    intermediate result. The Prover then uses this execution trace.\n"

"6.  **Prover**: The Prover computes the proofs for each train (that\n"

"7.  **Dispatcher**: The Dispatcher serves two functions in the SHARP\n"
"    system.\n"
"\n"
"    1.  In the case of a recursive proof, the Dispatcher runs the Cairo\n"
"        Verifier program on the proof it has received from the Prover,\n"
"        resulting in a new Cairo job that goes back to the Validator.\n"
"\n"
"    2.  In the case of a proof that needs to go on chain (e.g., to\n"
"        Ethereum), the Dispatcher creates \"packages\" from the proof,\n"
"        which can then be sent to the Blockchain Writer.\n"
"\n"
"8.  **Blockchain Writer**: Once the packages have been created by the\n"
"    Dispatcher, they are sent to the Blockchain Writer. The Blockchain\n"
"    Writer is responsible for sending the packages to the appropriate\n"
"    blockchain (e.g., Ethereum) for verification. This is an important\n"
"    step in the SHARP system, as it ensures that the proofs are properly\n"
"    verified and that the transactions are securely recorded on the\n"
"    blockchain.\n"
"\n"
"9.  **Catcher**: The Catcher monitors blockchain (e.g., Ethereum)\n"
"    transactions to ensure that they have been accepted. While the\n"
"    Catcher is relevant for internal monitoring purposes, it is\n"
"    important to note that if a transaction fails, the fact won’t be\n"
