= Blocks in Starknet

In Starknet, a block consists of a list of transactions and a block header. Blocks represent batches of transactions linked together by the hash of the preceding block in the chain. This connection of blocks forms a chain, as hashes are cryptographically generated from the block data. This structure ensures security and prevents fraud, as any alteration in a historical block would invalidate all subsequent blocks due to changes in their hashes. Consequently, every participant in the blockchain would quickly detect the discrepancy.

== Block Header

The block header consists of the following fields:

[cols="1,1,4,1",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Implemented
| parent_block_hash | FieldElement | The hash of this block’s parent | ✓
| block_number | Integer | The number (height) of this block | ✓
| global_state_root | FieldElement | The state commitment after this block | ✓
| sequencer_address | FieldElement | The Starknet address of the sequencer who created this block | ✓
| block_timestamp | Timestamp | The time the sequencer created this block before executing transactions | ✓
| transaction_count | Integer | The number of transactions in a block | ✓
| transaction_commitment | FieldElement | A commitment to the transactions included in the block | ✓
| event_count | Integer | The number of events | ✓
| event_commitment | FieldElement | A commitment to the events produced in this block | ✓
| protocol_version | Integer | The version of the Starknet protocol used when creating this block |
| extra_data | FieldElement | Extraneous data that might be useful for running transactions |
|===

[NOTE]
====
The commitment fields *event_commitment* and *transaction_commitment* are the roots of a height 64 binary Merkle Patricia tree.

The leaf at index _i_ corresponds to the hash of the *_i′th_* event for *event_commitment* and *_h(transaction hash,signature)_* for *invoke transaction_commitment*.

For other types of transactions, we use *h(0,0)*.

== Block Hash

The block hash is defined as the Pedersen hash over the header’s elements.

Poseidon is a family of hash functions designed for being very efficient as algebraic circuits. As such, they may be very useful in ZK proving systems such as STARKs and others.

Where *_h_* is the Pedersen hash.

[NOTE]
====
Zeros inside the hash computation of an object are used as placeholders, to be replaced in the future by meaningful fields.
