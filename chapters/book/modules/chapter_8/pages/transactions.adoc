= The Lifecycle of Transactions

On Starknet Alpha the two types of transactions are `DEPLOY` or `INVOKE`.
They go through the following lifecycle as they are submitted from the clients to the sequencer:

[.highlight, frame="single", options="header", background_color="#f5f5f5"]
|===
| NOT_RECEIVED \-> RECEIVED \-> PENDING \-> REJECTED || ACCEPTED_ON_L2 \-> ACCEPTED_ON_L1
|===


== Transaction status

=== NOT_RECEIVED

Transaction is not yet known to the sequencer.

=== RECEIVED

Transaction was received by the sequencer. Transaction will now either execute successfully or be rejected.

=== PENDING

Transaction executed successfully and entered the pending block.

=== REJECTED

Transaction executed unsuccessfully and thus was skipped. Or the block may be rejected on L1, thus resulting a status of *REJECTED*.

=== ACCEPTED_ON_L2

Transaction passed validation and entered an actual created block on Starknet.

=== ACCEPTED_ON_L1

Transaction was accepted on-chain.

== The pending block

During the construction of the block, as it is accumulating new transactions, the blockâ€™s status is *PENDING*. While status is *PENDING*, new transactions are dynamically added to the block. Once the sequencer decides to *close* the block, it becomes *ACCEPTED_ON_L2* and its hash is computed.

== Transaction receipt

The transaction receipt contains basic transaction details (block identifiers and the index within the block), a summary of the execution resources used by the transaction, the events emitted, a list of messages sent to L1, and a consumed L1 message (in case the transaction invokes an L1 handler). The following is an example of a receipt:
