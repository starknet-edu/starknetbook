== Euler's Theorem

In https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_theory[number theory], *Euler’s theorem* (also known as the 
*Fermat–Euler theorem* or *Euler’s totient theorem*) states that, if _n_ and _a_ are
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coprime_integers[coprime] positive integers, and _φ(n)_ is
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_totient_function[Euler’s totient
function], then _a_ raised to the power _φ(n)_ is congruent to 1
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_arithmetic[modulo] _n_; that is 

latexmath:[a^{φ(n)} ≡ 1 (mod‎ n)]

== Modular Arithmetic

A system of arithmetic for integers where numbers "wrap around" when reaching a certain value (aka 'modulus')

A real-world example of modular arithmetic is time-keeping via a clock. When the hour of the day exceeds the modulus(12) we "wrap" around and begin at zero.

Example:

In other words, of a division we sometimes are more interested in the *remainder*. Here is where we use the operator named as *modulo operator* or simply *mod*. For example,  $13\bmod5 = 3$ because $\frac\{13}\{5}=2$ remainder $3$.

Let's go through a couple examples:

* $-29\bmod3 = 1$

If we divide $-29$ by $3$ we get a quotient of $9$ with a remainder of $-2$; we substract $-2$ from $3$ (our modulus) to get $1$.

* $-9\bmod6 = 3$

Divide $-9$ by $6$ to get $-1$ as quotient with a remainder of $-3$. We then substract $-3$ from $6$ to get $3$ as our result.

* $7\bmod6 = 1$

Divide $7$ by $6$ to get a quotient of $1$ with a remainder of $1$, our result.

Note that the mod operator only gives positive numbers.

Modular arithmetic is the stepping stone for Fine Field Arithmetic which will take us to understand elliptic curve cryptography, which in turn, gives us the signing and verification algorithms in Ethereum. Signing and verification are key for transactions in a blockchain.

== Finite Fields

Much of today's practical cryptography is based on finite fields: a finite set of numbers with two operations (addition and multiplication from which we can define subtraction and division too).

The order or size of the field is usually called $p$ and is a prime number. This is a finite field of order $p$: $F_p =  {0, 1, 2, ..., p--1 }$. A finite field of order 3 would be: $F_3 =  {0, 1, 2}$.

A finite field cannot contain sub-fields since their order is prime. Therefore, the fine field implements the principles of modular arithmetic over a large, irreducible prime number.

Example:

A key property of the finite field is that if `a` and `b` are in the set, `a + b` and `a ⋅ b` should be in the set too. This is the *closed* property. Thus, if we have $F_3$ then the sum $1 + 2 = 3$ violates the closed property because $3$ is not in the set $F_3$. Something similar happens with the multiplication.

We need to make our finite field closed under arithmetic operations as addition, substraction, multiplication and division. Here is where modular arithmetic comes in handy. Most operations with finite fields will be using modular arithmetic. We represent a finite field addition as $+_f$ to distinguish it from a simple addition. We will do the same for the symbols of other arithmetic operators.

Now, for our finite field $F_3$, $1$ $+_f$ $2$ $=$ $(1+2) \bmod 3$ $=$ $0$. Also $2$ $⋅_f$ $2$ $=$ $(2⋅2) \bmod 3$ $=$ $1$. Now we have close operations for our finite field.

What about substraction? It is the same. For a finite field $F_3$, $1$ $-_f$ $2$ $=$ $(1-2) \bmod 3$ $=$ $2$. We are basically performing modular arithmetic where the modulo is the finite field's order. For multiplication the case is similar.

Addition, Multiplication, Exponentiation, and Substraction of fields are intuitive. However, Division of fields can be a bit challenging at the beginning. Let's begin with easy operations:

* For the finite field $F_3$, $2$ $/_f$ $2$ $=$ $(2/2) \bmod 3$ $=$ $1$. It makes sense since $2/2=1$.
* For the finite field $F_3$, $6$ $/_f$ $2$ $=$ $(0/2) \bmod 3$ $=$ $0$. It makes sense since $0/2=0$.
* For the finite field $F_3$, the operation $1$ $/_f$ $0$ $=$ $(1/0) \bmod 3$ can not be performed since we can not divide by 0.
* For the finite field $F_3$, $8$ $/_f$ $5$ $=$ $(2/2) \bmod 3$ $=$ $1$. It makes sense since $2/2=1$.

Until now everything seems ok. However, what happens when, for the finite field $F_5$, we divide $8$ $/_f$ $4$ $=$ $(3/4) \bmod 5$? The result is not trivial.
