= Arithmetization

The goal of the STARK protocol is to verify computations succinctly and transparently. It follows three steps:

. The first step in a STARK is called _arithmetization_, and it is the translation (often referred to as '`reduction`') of the problem of verifying a computation to the problem of checking that a certain polynomial, which can be evaluated efficiently on the verifier's side (this is the '`succinctly`' part), is of low degree. Arithmetization is useful since it enables the use of tools from the realm of Error Correction Codes that efficiently test low degree-ness.
. However, arithmetization itself only translates a Computational Integrity statement into a polynomial, setting the scene for the next phase in STARK, which is another interactive protocol that involves a prover that attempts to convince a verifier that the polynomial is indeed of low degree. The verifier is convinced that the polynomial is of low degree if and only if the original computation is correct (except for an infinitesimally small probability).
. In the last step of STARK, the interactive protocol is transformed into a single non-interactive proof, that can be posted to a blockchain and publicly verified by anyone.

Arithmetization itself is composed of two steps. The first is generating an execution trace and polynomial constraints, the second is transforming these two objects into a single low-degree polynomial. In terms of prover-verifier interaction, what really goes on is that the prover and the verifier agree on what the polynomial constraints are in advance. The prover then generates an execution trace, and in the subsequent interaction, the prover tries to convince the verifier that the polynomial constraints are satisfied over this execution trace, unseen by the verifier. Let's review each step.

== Step 1: Generating an execution trace and a set of polynomial constraints

The first step takes some CI statement (such as "`the fifth transaction in block 7218290 is correct`"), and translate it into formal algebraic language. This serves two purposes: 1) it defines the claim succinctly in an unambiguous way, and 2) it embeds the claim in an algebraic domain. This embedding is what allows the second step of arithmetization, which reduces the CI statement to a claim about the degree of a specific polynomial.

The algebraic representation that we use has two main components: 1) an execution trace, and 2) a set of polynomial constraints. The execution trace is a table that represents the steps of the underlying computation, where each row represents a single step. The set of polynomial constraints is constructed such that all of them are satisfied if and only if the trace represents a valid computation. While the execution trace may be very long, we will work with a succinct set of polynomial constraints.

The type of execution trace that we're looking to generate must have the special trait of being succinctly testable -- each row can be verified relying only on rows that are close to it in the trace, and the same verification procedure is applied to each pair of rows. This trait directly affects the size of the proof. To exemplify what we mean by being succinctly testable, let's go back to the supermarket receipt, and add another column for the running total:

image::receipt2.png[receipt2]

This simple addition allows us to verify each row individually, given its previous row.

We can, for example, examine these two rows:

image::receipt3.png[receipt3]

We would be convinced that this particular step of the computation (i.e. the number 16.41) is correct since 12.96+3.45=16.41. Notice that the same constraint is applied to each pair of rows. This is what we mean by succinct constraints.

Let's proceed with the polynomial constraints. We rewrite the supermarket receipt (with the running total) in the form of a table:

image::receipt4.png[receipt4]

Denote the value of the cell in the $i$-th row and $j$-th column by $A_{i,j}$. We can now rephrase the correctness conditions as this set of polynomial constraints:

image::constraints.png[constraints]

These are linear polynomial constraints in Ai,j. If the set of polynomial constraints we use are of high degree, this has an adverse effect on the proof length and the time it takes to generate it. Consequently, linear constraints are the best we can hope for. Notice that (2) is really a single constraint applied multiple times, and the whole size of the set is independent of the length of the receipt.

In sum, we took a CI problem of verifying a supermarket receipt, and transformed it into a succinctly testable execution trace, and a corresponding set of polynomial constraints that hold if and only if the total sum in the original receipt is correct.

Let's see a more complex example: the Collatz Conjecture.

In 1937, a German mathematician named Lothar Collatz presented a conjecture in the field of number theory. At first glance this conjecture might seem merely a cute math puzzle, but in fact it is a hard open problem in number theory. It caught the attention of many mathematicians over the years, and acquired a lot of synonyms (e.g., the $3n + 1$ conjecture, the Ulam conjecture, Kakutani's problem and many more). Paul Erdős once said about this conjecture: "`Mathematics may not be ready for such problems`".

A Collatz sequence starts with any positive integer, where each subsequent element in the sequence is obtained from the previous one as follows:

If the previous element is even: divide it by 2.
If the previous element is odd and greater than 1: multiply it by 3 and add 1.
If the previous element is 1, stop.
Let's consider a simple example where the initial term is 52:

$52 \-> 26 \-> 13 \-> 40 \-> 20 \-> 10 \-> 5 \-> 16 \-> 8 \-> 4 \-> 2 \-> 1$.

*Collatz Conjecture*: for any positive integer we start with, the sequence always reaches 1.

Unfortunately, resolving the Collatz Conjecture is beyond the scope of this tutorial. Instead, we will consider the problem of verifying a computation that checks the conjecture for a particular starting integer.

The Collatz Sequence Execution Trace
The CI statement is: "`A Collatz sequence that starts with 52, ends with 1 after 11 iterations`".

Let A be the execution trace of the sequence's computation. The i-th row, denoted by Ai, represents the i-th number in the sequence. All numbers are represented as binary strings, to make it easier to express the odd/even condition with polynomials. Ai,j equals to the j-th least significant bit of the i-th number of the sequence. For example, A0=001011: the first term is 52, its binary representation is 110100 and then we reverse the bits`' order (bit reversal order simplifies indexing in the polynomial constraints notation).

Here is the execution trace of the above Collatz sequence that starts with 52:

image::collatz.png[collatz]

Note that here the trace has 6 columns because 6 bits are enough to represent even the largest number in the sequence. Had we started the sequence with 51, the next number would have been 154, so the trace of such a sequence would have required at least 8 columns.

Recall that the polynomial constraints we are looking for are such that all of them are satisfied if and only if the trace A describes the given Collatz sequence (starting with 52, ending with 1, and the transition from any two consecutive rows is done correctly). In our example, the trace A is of size 6x12, i.e., it represents a Collatz sequence of 12 6-bit numbers. The set of polynomial constraints are the following ($n=12$, $m=6$):

image::collatz2.png[collatz2]

Let's go over each of the constraints. The first three are straightforward:

. holds if and only if the first row is a binary representation of 52.
. holds if and only if the last row is a binary representation of 1.
. holds if and only if the trace contains only bits (a number is equal to its square if and only if it is either 0 or 1).

The fourth set of constraints defines the heart of the succinct computation of the sequence, i.e., the connection between every two consecutive rows. The ability to express computational constraints as a recurring pattern of local constraints (i.e. succinctness), is fundamental to the verifier being exponentially faster than a naive replay of the computation.

Let's examine the constraints themselves carefully.

For any $i<n-1$, denote:

image::collatz3.png[collatz3]

Hence, for each $i<n-1$, we get the following constraint:

image::collatz4.png[collatz4]

$A_{i,0}$ is the least significant bit of the $i$-th number, which determines its parity as an integer, so this constraint describes the Collatz sequence rule.

To sum up, all constraints are satisfied if and only if the trace represents a valid computation of a Collatz sequence.

Note that any Collatz sequence of length n, can be represented using a trace of size n*m where m is the maximum number of bits in the representation of a number in the sequence, and the corresponding polynomial constraints are modified accordingly. Note that the polynomial constraints do not grow with n and m, but remain simple and concise.

Given a specific first term for a Collatz sequence, a simple computer program can output the execution trace and the polynomial constraints. We have seen how a CI statement about a Collatz sequence can be transformed into an execution trace and a succinctly-described set of polynomial constraints. Similar methods can be used to transform any computation, and in general, any CI statement can be translated into this form.

The details, however, matter a great deal. While there are many ways in which an execution trace (and a set of polynomial constraints) may describe a specific computation, only a handful of them result in a small STARK proof which can be constructed efficiently. Much of the effort in Starkware is devoted to designing reductions that lead to good polynomial constraints, which we call AIR (Algebraic Intermediate Representation), as much of the performance of our systems depends on it.

== Step 2: Transform the execution trace and the set of polynomial constraints into a single low-degree polynomial

Using a Fibonacci sequence, we will show how the prover can combine the execution trace and the polynomial constraints to obtain a polynomial that is guaranteed to be of low degree if and only if the execution trace satisfies the polynomial constraints that we started with. Moreover, we will show how the domain over which the polynomial is considered allows the verifier to evaluate it succinctly. We also briefly discuss how error correction codes play a role in STARKs.

[XXX Should we add fine fields here? We will assume familiarity with finite groups, polynomials over finite fields, and the previous posts in this series.]

Recall that our goal is to make it possible for a verifier to ask a prover a very small number of questions, and decide whether to accept or reject the proof with a guaranteed high level of accuracy. Ideally, the verifier would like to ask the prover to provide the values in a few (random) places in the execution trace, and check that the polynomial constraints hold for these places. A correct execution trace will naturally pass this test. However, it is not hard to construct a completely wrong execution trace, that violates the constraints only at a single place, and, doing so, reach a completely far and different outcome. Identifying this fault via a small number of random queries is highly improbable.

Common techniques that address similar problems are https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_detection_and_correction[*Error Correction Codes*].

Error Correction Codes transform a set of strings, some of which may be very similar to one another, into a set of strings that are pairwise very different, by replacing the original strings with longer strings.

Interestingly, polynomials can be used to construct good error correction codes, since two polynomials of degree d, evaluated on a domain that is considerably larger than $d$, are different almost everywhere (to see this, notice that the difference between distinct degree-$d$ polynomials is a non-zero polynomial of degree $d$, hence has at most $d$ zeros). Such codes are called *Reed-Solomon* codes.

Observing that, we can extend the execution trace by thinking of it as an evaluation of a polynomial on some domain, and evaluating this same polynomial on a much larger domain. Extending in a similar fashion an incorrect execution trace, results in a vastly different string, which in turn makes it possible for the verifier to distinguish between these cases using a small number of queries.

Our plan is therefore to 1) rephrase the execution trace as a polynomial, 2) extend it to a large domain, and 3) transform that, using the polynomial constraints, into yet another polynomial that is guaranteed to be of low degree if and only if the execution trace is valid.

*Toy Example: Boolean Execution Trace*

Suppose that the CI statement in question is "`The prover has a sequence of 512 numbers, all of which are either 0 or 1`", which we would like to verify by reading substantially less than 512 numbers. Let's see what kind of execution trace and polynomial constraints express this toy example:

. The execution trace has $512$ rows, each row containing a single cell with either zero or one in it.
. The polynomial constraint we use here is simply $A_\{ᵢ}⋅A_\{ᵢ}-A_\{ᵢ}=0$, where $A_\{ᵢ}$ denotes the $i$-th cell in this single-column execution trace (a number is equal to its square if and only if it is either 0 or 1).

[cols=3*]
|===
| In order to rephrase this execution trace in terms of polynomials, we specify the field we will be working in -- we go with $Z_{₉₆₇₆₉}$, obtained from the set of integers ${0,1,...,96768}$ with addition and multiplication modulo $96769$. Next we pick a subgroup $G$ of $Z_{₉₆₇₆₉}{caret}{_}$ (we use $F_$ to denote the multiplicative group of $F$; the multiplicative group is obtained by omitting the zero element from the field) such that $
| G
| =512$, and some generator $g$ of $G$. The existence of such a subgroup is guaranteed since $512$ divides the size of this group (which is $96768$).
|===

We now think of the elements in the execution trace as evaluations of some polynomial f(x) of degree less than 512 in the following way: the i-th cell contains the evaluation of f on the generator's i-th power.

Formally:

image::generator.png[generator]

Such a polynomial of degree at most 512 can be computed by interpolation, and we then proceed to evaluate it on a much larger domain (choosing this domain's size directly translates into the soundness error, the bigger it is -- the smaller the soundness error), forming a special case of Reed-Solomon codeword.

Lastly, we use this polynomial to create another one, whose low degreeness depends on the constraint being satisfied over the execution trace.

To do so, we must go on a tangent and discuss roots of polynomials.

A basic fact about polynomials and their roots is that if $p(x)$ is a polynomial, then $p(a)=0$ for some specific value $a$, if and only if there exists a polynomial $q(x)$ such that $(x-a)q(x)=p(x)$, and $deg(p)=deg(q)+1$.

Moreover, for all $x≠a$, we can evaluate $q(x)$ by computing:

image::root.png[root]

By induction, a similar fact is true for $k$ roots. Namely, if $a_\{ᵢ}$ is a root of p for all $i=0..k-1$, then there exists a polynomial $q$ of degree $deg(p)-k$, and in all but these $k$ values, it is exactly equal to:

image::kroots.png[kroots]

Rephrasing the polynomial constraint in terms of f yields the following polynomial:

image::polConstraint.png[polConstraint]

We have defined $f$ such that the roots of this expression are $1$, $g$, $g²$, $...$, $g⁵¹¹$ if and only if the cells in the execution trace are $0$ or $1$. We can define:

image::polConstraint2.png[polConstraint2]

And we know from the previous paragraph that there exists a polynomial of degree at most $2·deg(f)-512$ that agrees with $p$ on all $x ∉{1, g, g{caret}\{2}, ..., g{caret}\{511}}$ if and only if the execution trace is indeed a list of 512 bits (i.e., 0 or 1). Note that earlier on, the prover has extended the execution trace to a larger domain, so querying for the polynomial values in that domain is well defined.

If there exists a protocol by which the prover can convince (such that the verifier is convinced if and only if the prover is not cheating) the verifier that this polynomial is of low degree, such that in it the verifier only asks for values outside the execution trace, then indeed the verifier will be convinced about the truthfulness of the CI statement only when it is true. In fact, in the next post, we will show a protocol that does exactly that, with some very small probability of error. For the time being -- let's take a look at another example, that is still simple, but not completely trivial, and see how the reduction works in that case.

*Not so trivial example: Fibonacci*

The example that we use next is that of correctly computing a Fibonacci sequence in $Z_{₉₆₇₆₉}$ to the $512$-th place. The sequence is defined formally by:

image::fibonacci1.png[fibonacci1]

And our claim (i.e., the CI statement) is that $a_{₅₁₁}=62215$.

We can create an execution trace for this CI statement by simply writing down all 512 numbers:

image::fibonacci2.png[fibonacci2]

The polynomial constraints that we use are

image::fibonacci3.png[fibonacci3]

Now we translate into Polynomials.

Here, too, we define a polynomial $f(x)$ of degree at most $512$, such that the elements in the execution trace are evaluations of $f$ in powers of some generator $g$.

Formally:

image::fibonacci4.png[fibonacci4]

Expressing the polynomial constraints in terms of $f$ instead of $A$, we get:

image::fibonacci5.png[fibonacci5]

Since a composition of polynomials is still a polynomial -- substituting the $Aᵢ$ in the constraints with $f(gⁱ)$ still means these are polynomial constraints.

Note that 1, 2, and 4 are constraints that refer to a single value of $f$, we refer to them as boundary constraints.

The Fibonacci recurrence relation, in contrast, embodies a set of constraints over the entire execution trace, and it may be alternatively rephrased as:

image::fibonacci6.png[fibonacci6]

The use of a generator to index the rows of the execution trace allows us to encode the notion of "`next row`" as a simple algebraic relation. If x is some row in the execution trace, then $gx$ is the next row, $g²x$ is the row after that, $g⁻¹x$ is the previous row and so on.

The recurrence relation polynomial: $f(g²x)-f(gx)-f(x)$ is zero for every $x$ that indexes a row in the execution trace, except for the last two. It means that 1, $g$, $g²$, $...$, $g⁵⁰⁹$ are all roots of this recurrence relation polynomial (and it is of degree at most 510), so we can construct $q(x)$ as follows:

image::fibonacci7.png[fibonacci7]

In STARK lore, this is often referred to as the composition polynomial. Indeed, when the original execution trace obeys the Fibonacci recurrence relation, this expression agrees with some polynomial whose degree is at most 2 (recall that the degree of f is at most 512) on all but these 510 values: 1, $g$, $g²$, $...$, $g⁵⁰⁹$. However, the term composition polynomial is somewhat misleading, as when the execution trace does not satisfy the polynomial constraint -- the evaluations of this expression differ from any low degree polynomial in many places. In other words -- it is close to a low-degree polynomial if and only if the original CI is correct, which indeed was our goal.

This concludes the promised reduction, that translates the problem of checking whether certain polynomial constraints are satisfied over some execution trace, to the problem of checking whether some polynomial (known to the prover) is of low degree.

Succinctness

Having a very efficient verification technique is key to STARKs, and it can be seen as comprised of two parts -- using a small number of queries, and having the verifier perform a small computation on each query. The former is achieved by error correction codes, which allow querying in very few places, and the latter we have sort of swept under the rug throughout this post, until now. The verifier's work can be summed up as 1) querying the composition polynomial in random places, and 2) checking low-degreeness based on these queries. Low degreeness succinct checking will be handled in the next post, but what exactly do we mean by "`querying the composition polynomial`"? The avid reader may have been suspicious of this expression, and rightfully so. The prover, after all, may be malicious. When the verifier asks for the evaluation of the composition polynomial at some x, the prover may reply with the evaluation of some truly low-degree polynomial, that will pass any low-degree testing, but is not the composition polynomial.

To prevent this, the verifier explicitly queries the Fibonacci execution trace at some row w by asking for the values of $f$ in three places: $f(w)$, $f(gw)$, $f(g²w)$.

The verifier can now compute the value of the composition polynomial at w by:

image::succinctness.png[succintness]

Where the numerator can be computed using the values obtained from the prover, and the denominator... well, there's the rub (that was swept under the rug).

On the one hand the denominator is completely independent of the execution trace, so the verifier can compute it before ever communicating with the prover.

On the other hand, in practicality -- the trace may be comprised of hundreds of thousands of rows, and computing the denominator would cost the verifier dearly in running time.

Here's where the arithmetization is crucial to succinctness -- since calculating this expression for the special case where the powers of g form a subgroup can be done very efficiently if one notices that:

image::succinctness2.png[succinctness2]

[cols=3*]
|===
| This equality is true because both sides are polynomials of degree $
| G
| $ whose roots are exactly the elements of $G$.
|===

[cols=5*]
|===
| Computing the right hand side of this equation seems to require a number of operations that is linear in $
| G
| $. However, if we resort to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponentiation_by_squaring[exponentiation by squaring], the left hand side of this equation can be computed in running time that is logarithmic in $
| G
| $.
|===

And the actual denominator of the Fibonacci composition polynomial in question can be obtained by rewriting it as:

image::succinctness3.png[succinctness3]

This seeming technicality stands at the core of the verifier being able to run in polylogarithmic time, and it is enabled only because we view the execution trace as evaluations of a polynomial over some subgroup of the field, and that the polynomial constraints in question hold over a subgroup.

Similar tricks can be applied for more sophisticated execution traces, but it is crucial that the repeating pattern of the constraint coincides with some subgroup of the field.

More Constraints, More Columns!

The examples in this post were deliberately simple, to highlight key aspects of arithmetization. A natural question that arises will be: how is the case of multiple columns and multiple constraints handled. The answer is straightforward: multiple columns simply mean that there's more than one polynomial to work with, and multiple composition polynomials -- resulting from the multiple constraints -- are combined into a single polynomial, a random linear combination of all of them, for the sake of the last phase in STARK, which is a low degree test. With high probability, the linear combination is of low degree if and only if so are all of its components.

We have shown how, given an execution trace and constraint polynomials, the prover can construct a polynomial which is of low degree if and only if the original CI statement holds. Furthermore, we have shown how the verifier can query the values of this polynomial efficiently, making sure that the prover did not replace the true polynomial with some false low-degree one.

Next we will go into the details of low-degree testing, showing how this magic, of querying a small number of values and determining whether some polynomial is of low degree, is done.
