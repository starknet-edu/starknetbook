= Verifiers in Solidity

L1 smart contract that verifies STARK proofs from SHARP.

In the discussion below, we will encounter several contracts:

- https://etherscan.io/address/0x47312450b3ac8b5b8e247a6bb6d523e7605bdb60[Starkware Sharp Verifier]: Proxy contract
- https://etherscan.io/address/0x6cb3ee90c50a38a0e4662bb7e7e6e40b91361bf6[GpsStatementVerifier]: Contract that verifies a proof and registers the corresponding facts.
- https://etherscan.io/address/0xe9664d230490d5a515ef7ef30033d8075a8d0e24[CpuFrilessVerifier]
- https://etherscan.io/address/0xfd14567eaf9ba941cb8c8a94eec14831ca7fd1b4[MemoryPageFactRegistry]

== Example of a Verifier transaction

Let's take a look at a transaction that was sent to the Verifier contract on Ethereum mainnet. 
https://etherscan.io/tx/0xde0bcb45698e8ef67fef8bff8615715dac0cf0882a131a21273e58607330d5f9[0xde0bcb45698e8ef67fef8bff8615715dac0cf0882a131a21273e58607330d5f9]

=== Transaction trace

* Verifier contract is a proxy contract so when it's called, implementation contract is called instead. Implementation contract is GpsStatementVerifier contract. The transaction that set the latest implementation can be find https://etherscan.io/tx/0xbaa8ffb1b7e5177dbf75de753b9b2ff2fc313b244ff910cfd6d7f1f6254b6e1a[here]

* On GpsStatementVerifier contract, function `verifyProofAndRegister` got executed with the following trace, you can check its code https://github.com/starkware-libs/starkex-contracts/blob/aecf37f2278b2df233edd13b686d0aa9462ada02/evm-verifier/solidity/contracts/gps/GpsStatementVerifier.sol#L71[here]:
    
    - `call` MemoryPageFactRegistry.registerRegularMemoryPage(), code https://github.com/starkware-libs/starkex-contracts/blob/aecf37f2278b2df233edd13b686d0aa9462ada02/evm-verifier/solidity/contracts/cpu/MemoryPageFactRegistry.sol#L31%5Bhere%5D[here]. This function 
        . Computes and stores the factHash in the mapping verifiedFact; 
        . Emits an event LogMemoryPageFactRegular with factHash = `0x72C8D723081B60693B32D77A369782FF189754A5897002314FB1569B7E2EE1E2`

    - `call` CpuFrilessVerifier.verifyProofExternal(), code https://github.com/starkware-libs/starkex-contracts/blob/aecf37f2278b2df233edd13b686d0aa9462ada02/evm-verifier/solidity/contracts/cpu/CpuVerifier.sol#L54[here] that leads to the https://github.com/starkware-libs/starkex-contracts/blob/aecf37f2278b2df233edd13b686d0aa9462ada02/evm-verifier/solidity/contracts/StarkVerifier.sol#L500[StarkVerifier] contract. 
    
    - Then that makes a `staticcall` to MemoryPageFactRegistry.isValid() with argument is the factHash mentioned above, and get the respond true

    - You can check by yourself by querying the `isValid` function on MemoryPageFactRegistry contract with input `0x72C8D723081B60693B32D77A369782FF189754A5897002314FB1569B7E2EE1E2` to have `true` as output.



== Verifier contract in Starknet architecture
The example above shows the example of verifying/registering proof on Ethereum and gives a glimpse of how the Verifier contract is used in the Starknet architecture.

In general, SHARP takes the Cairo program’s execution trace, proves that it’s valid, and sends this proof to the Verifier contract on Ethereum. After verifying the proof, the on-chain verifier takes an important extra step: it writes a fact attesting to the validity of the proof in the Fact Registry. This fact is like a trustless stamp of approval, certifying that the Cairo program was computed correctly. Now all that is left for the dApp’s smart contract is to check that this fact exists, in order to rely on the computation that was executed off-chain.

Here is the overall diagram of the how each component interacts with each other in the Starknet architecture.
