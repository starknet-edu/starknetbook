= Introduction to the STARKs

By now there are quite a few theoretical constructions of proof systems, along with implementations. Some are deployed in cryptocurrencies, like the https://z.cash/technology/zksnarks/[SNARKs] used by http://zerocash-project.org/paper[Zerocash], https://z.cash/[Zcash], and https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066[Bulletproofs] (BP) deployed in https://ww.getmonero.org/[Monero]. (For general information on proof systems go https://zkp.science/[here].) What distinguishes https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/046[STARKs] is the combination of the following three properties: scalability (the S in STARK), transparency (the T in STARK), and lean cryptography.

== Scalability: Exponential Speedup of Verification**

Scalability means that two efficiency properties hold simultaneously:

* *Scalable Prover*: The prover's running time is "`nearly-linear`" in the time it would take a trusted computer to check CI by just re-executing the computation themselves and checking that the result matches what someone is claiming. The ratio of "`overhead`" (time needed to generate a proof / time needed to just run the computation) remains reasonably low.
* *Scalable Verifier*: The verifier's running time is polynomial in the logarithm of naive replay time. In other words, the verifier's runtime is exponentially smaller than simply replaying the computation (recall that '`replay`' is the current blockchain method to achieve Inclusive Accountability).

Apply this notion of scalability to a blockchain. Instead of the current mode of verification by naive replay, imagine how things will look when a blockchain moves to verification by using proof systems. Instead of simply sending the transactions to be added to the blockchain, a prover node will need to generate a proof but thanks to the Scalable Prover its running time is nearly-linear in the running time of the naive replay solution. And the Scalable Verifier will benefit from an exponential decrease in its verification time. Furthermore, as blockchain throughput scales up, most of the effect will be shouldered by the prover nodes (which could run on dedicated hardware, like miners), whereas the verifiers, which would constitute most of the nodes in the network, would hardly be affected.

Let's consider a concrete hypothetical example, assuming verifier time (in milliseconds) scales like the square of the logarithm of the number of transactions (tx). Suppose we start with 10,000 tx/block. Then the verifier's running time is

$VTime = (log₂ 10,000)² ~ (13.2)² ~ 177 ms$.

Now increase the blocksize a hundredfold (to 1,000,000 tx/block). The new running time of the verifier is

$VTime = (log₂ 1,000,000)² ~ 20² ~ 400 ms$.

In words, a 100x increase in transaction throughput led only to a 2.25x increase in the verifier's running time!

In some cases, the verifier will still need to download and verify _availability of data_, which is a linear-time process, but downloading data is generally much cheaper and faster than checking its validity.

== Transparency: With Trust Toward None, with Integrity for All

Transparency means there is no trusted setup (formally, a transparent proof system is one in which all verifier messages are public random strings. Such systems are also known as https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur%E2%80%93Merlin_protocol[Arthur-Merlin protocols]) -- there is no use of secrets in the setting up of the system. Transparency offers many benefits. It eliminates the parameter setup generation procedure which constitutes a single point of failure. The lack of a trusted setup allows even powerful entities -- big corporations, monopolies and governments, which control the "`old world`" financial system -- to prove CI and gain public acceptance of their claims because there's no known way to forge STARK proofs of falsities, even by the most powerful of entities. On a more tactical level, it makes it much easier to deploy new tools and infrastructure and change existing ones without a need for elaborate parameter-generation ceremonies. Most importantly, transparency aligns well with the "`new world`" that demands Inclusive Accountability under no trust assumptions. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln%27s_second_inaugural_address[To paraphrase Abraham Lincoln], transparent systems allow to operate with trust toward none, with integrity for all.

== Lean Cryptography: Secure & Fast
STARK has minimal cryptographic assumptions underlying its security: the existence of secure cryptographic and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collision_resistance[collision-resistant hash functions] (this minimality of cryptographic assumptions holds for interactive STARKs (iSTARKs). Noninteractive STARKs (nSTARKs) require the Fiat-Shamir heuristic which is a different beast). Many of these primitives exist today as hardware instructions, and the lean cryptography leads to two more benefits:

* *Post-Quantum Security*: STARKs are plausibly secure against efficient quantum computers.
* *Concrete Efficiency*: For a given computation, the STARK prover is at least 10x faster than both the SNARK and Bulletproofs prover. The STARK verifier is at least 2x faster than the SNARK verifier and more than 10x faster than the Bulletproof verifier. As Starkware continues to optimize STARKs these ratios will likely improve. However, a STARK proof length is ~100x larger than the corresponding SNARK and ~20x larger than BulletProofs.

To understand how STARKs are computed, we need to delve into the arithmetic of modular operations, finite fields, and polynomials. For this we will need to touch mathematical concepts that at first glance might seem complicated, however, you will see that it is easier than you thought.
