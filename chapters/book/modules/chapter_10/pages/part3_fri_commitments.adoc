== FRI Folding

Our goal in this part is to construct the FRI layers and commit on them.
To obtain each layer we need:

. To generate a domain for the layer (from the previous layer's domain).
. To generate a polynomial for the layer (from the previous layer's
polynomial and domain).
. To evaluate said polynomial on said domain - *this is the next FRI
layer*.

== Domain Generation

The first FRI domain is simply the `eval_domain` that you already
generated in Part 1, namely a coset of a group of order 8192. Each
subsequent FRI domain is obtained by taking the first half of the
previous FRI domain (dropping the second half), and squaring each of its
elements.

Formally - we got `eval_domain` by taking:

[latexmath]
++++
\[w, w\cdot h, w\cdot h^2, ..., w\cdot h^{8191}\]
++++

The next layer will therefore be:

[latexmath]
++++
\[w^2, (w\cdot h)^2, (w\cdot h^2)^2, ..., (w\cdot h^{4095})^2\]
++++

Note that taking the squares of the second half of each elements in
`eval_domain` yields exactly the same result as taking the squares of
the first half. This is true for the next layers as well. For example:

[source,python]
----
print(eval_domain[100] ** 2)
half_domain_size = len(eval_domain) // 2
print(eval_domain[half_domain_size + 100] ** 2)
----

Similarly, the domain of the third layer will be:

[latexmath]
++++
\[w^4, (w\cdot h)^4, (w\cdot h^2)^4, ..., (w\cdot h^{2047})^4\]
++++

And so on.

Write a function `next_fri_domain` that takes the previous domain as an
argument, and outputs the next one.

Solution:

[source,python]
----
def next_fri_domain(fri_domain):
    return [x ** 2 for x in fri_domain[:len(fri_domain) // 2]]
----

Run test:

[source,python]
----
# Test against a precomputed hash.
from hashlib import sha256
next_domain = next_fri_domain(eval_domain)
assert '5446c90d6ed23ea961513d4ae38fc6585f6614a3d392cb087e837754bfd32797' == sha256(','.join([str(i) for i in next_domain]).encode()).hexdigest()
print('Success!')
----

== FRI Folding Operator

The first FRI polynomial is simply the composition polynomial, i.e.,
`cp`. Each subsequent FRI polynomial is obtained by:

. Getting a random field element latexmath:[$\beta$] (by calling
`Channel.receive_random_field_element`).
. Multiplying the odd coefficients of the previous polynomial by
latexmath:[$\beta$].
. Summing together consecutive pairs (even-odd) of coefficients.

Formally, let's say that the k-th polynomial is of degree
latexmath:[$< m$] (for some latexmath:[$m$] which is a power of 2):

[latexmath]
++++
\[p_{k}(x) := \sum _{i=0} ^{m-1} c_i x^i\]
++++

Then the (k+1)-th polynomial, whose degree is $< \frac m 2 $ will be:

[latexmath]
++++
\[p_{k+1}(x) := \sum _{i=0} ^{  m / 2 - 1 } (c_{2i} + \beta \cdot c_{2i + 1}) x^i\]
++++

Write a function `next_fri_polynomial` that takes as arguments a
polynomial and a field element (the one we referred to as
latexmath:[$\beta$]), and returns the "folded" next polynomial.

Note that:

. `Polynomial.poly` contains a list of a polynomial's coefficients, the
free term first, and the highest degree last, so `p.poly[i] == u` if the
coefficient of latexmath:[$x^i$] is latexmath:[$u$].*
. `Polynomial`'s default constructor takes the list of coefficients as
argument. So a polynomial can be instantiated from a list of
coefficients `l` by calling `Polynomial(l)`.

Solution:

[source,python]
----
def next_fri_polynomial(poly,  beta):
    odd_coefficients = poly.poly[1::2]
    even_coefficients = poly.poly[::2]
    odd = beta * Polynomial(odd_coefficients)
    even = Polynomial(even_coefficients)
    return odd + even
----

Run test:

[source,python]
----
next_p = next_fri_polynomial(cp, FieldElement(987654321))
assert '6bff4c35e1aa9693f9ceb1599b6a484d7636612be65990e726e52a32452c2154' == sha256(','.join([str(i) for i in next_p.poly]).encode()).hexdigest()
print('Success!')
----

== Putting it Together to Get the Next FRI Layer

Write a function `next_fri_layer` that takes a polynomial, a domain, and
a field element (again - latexmath:[$\beta$]), and returns the next
polynomial, the next domain, and the evaluation of this next polynomial
on this next domain.

Solution:

[source,python]
----
def next_fri_layer(poly, domain, beta):
    next_poly = next_fri_polynomial(poly, beta)
    next_domain = next_fri_domain(domain)
    next_layer = [next_poly(x) for x in next_domain]
    return next_poly, next_domain, next_layer
----

Run test:

[source,python]
----
test_poly = Polynomial([FieldElement(2), FieldElement(3), FieldElement(0), FieldElement(1)])
test_domain = [FieldElement(3), FieldElement(5)]
beta = FieldElement(7)
next_p, next_d, next_l = next_fri_layer(test_poly, test_domain, beta)
assert next_p.poly == [FieldElement(23), FieldElement(7)]
assert next_d == [FieldElement(9)]
assert next_l == [FieldElement(86)]
print('Success!')
----

== Generating FRI Commitments

We have now developed the tools to write the `FriCommit` method, that
contains the main FRI commitment loop.

It takes the following 5 arguments:

. The composition polynomial, that is also the first FRI polynomial,
that is - `cp`.
. The coset of order 8192 that is also the first FRI domain, that is -
`eval_domain`.
. The evaluation of the former over the latter, which is also the first
FRI layer, that is - `cp_eval`.
. The first Merkle tree (we will have one for each FRI layer)
constructed from these evaluations, that is - `cp_merkle`.
. A channel object, that is `channel`.

The method accordingly returns 4 lists:

. The FRI polynomials.
. The FRI domains.
. The FRI layers.
. The FRI Merkle trees.

The method contains a loop, in each iteration of which we extend these
four lists, using the last element in each. The iteration should stop
once the last FRI polynomial is of degree 0, that is - when the last FRI
polynomial is just a constant. It should then send over the channel this
constant (i.e. - the polynomial's free term). The `Channel` class only
supports sending strings, so make sure you convert anything you wish to
send over the channel to a string before sending.

Solution:

[source,python]
----
def FriCommit(cp, domain, cp_eval, cp_merkle, channel):    
    fri_polys = [cp]
    fri_domains = [domain]
    fri_layers = [cp_eval]
    fri_merkles = [cp_merkle]
    while fri_polys[-1].degree() > 0:
        beta = channel.receive_random_field_element()
        next_poly, next_domain, next_layer = next_fri_layer(fri_polys[-1], fri_domains[-1], beta)
        fri_polys.append(next_poly)
        fri_domains.append(next_domain)
        fri_layers.append(next_layer)
        fri_merkles.append(MerkleTree(next_layer))
        channel.send(fri_merkles[-1].root)   
    channel.send(str(fri_polys[-1].poly[0]))
    return fri_polys, fri_domains, fri_layers, fri_merkles
----

Run test:

[source,python]
----
test_channel = Channel()
fri_polys, fri_domains, fri_layers, fri_merkles = FriCommit(cp, eval_domain, cp_eval, cp_merkle, test_channel)
assert len(fri_layers) == 11, f'Expected number of FRI layers is 11, whereas it is actually {len(fri_layers)}.'
assert len(fri_layers[-1]) == 8, f'Expected last layer to contain exactly 8 elements, it contains {len(fri_layers[-1])}.'
assert all([x == FieldElement(-1138734538) for x in fri_layers[-1]]), f'Expected last layer to be constant.'
assert fri_polys[-1].degree() == 0, 'Expected last polynomial to be constant (degree 0).'
assert fri_merkles[-1].root == '1c033312a4df82248bda518b319479c22ea87bd6e15a150db400eeff653ee2ee', 'Last layer Merkle root is wrong.'
assert test_channel.state == '61452c72d8f4279b86fa49e9fb0fdef0246b396a4230a2bfb24e2d5d6bf79c2e', 'The channel state is not as expected.'
print('Success!')

and print the proof so far:

[source,python]

fri_polys, fri_domains, fri_layers, fri_merkles = FriCommit(cp, eval_domain, cp_eval, cp_merkle, channel)
print(channel.proof)
