= C(pu)AIR(o)

The STARK Proof system is based on `AIR` or Algebraic Intermediate Representation of computation. The AIR is a list of polynomial constraints operating on a trace of finite field elements and the STARK Proof verifies there exists a trace that satisfies those constraints.

Cairo stands for CPU AIR and consists of a single set of polynomial constraints such that the execution of a program on this architecture is valid. Cairo is a programming language for writing provable programs.
