= The Starknet Roadmap - A Developer-Focused Approach

Starknet's roadmap is a testament to the network's commitment to developers, placing performance and transaction cost as its highest priorities.

This is a general overview of the Starknet roadmap. For more details, please refer to the https://docs.starknet.io/documentation/starknet_versions/upcoming_versions/[Starknet documentation].

== Throughput and Latency

The core focus of Starknet's immediate future developments is enhancing performance, with major emphasis on boosting throughput and decreasing latency.

* The upcoming Starknet v0.12.0, planned for release soon, will incorporate substantial throughput and latency improvements, primarily attributed to transitioning to a Rust-based Sequencer and the new Rust-Cairo Virtual Machine (VM).
* This transition is expected to dramatically reduce block execution time, thereby significantly increasing the throughput of transactions.

As Starknet continues to grow and evolve, throughput and latency will remain top priorities, as the network strives to offer an increasingly performant platform for developers to build upon.

== Transaction Costs

Reducing transaction costs is another paramount aspect of Starknet's roadmap. Lower transaction costs equate to a more accessible network, a critical factor in promoting broader adoption of Starknet's technology.

* Starknet v0.13.0 is expected to greatly reduce transaction costs by minimizing Layer 1 (Ethereum) data cost, which currently accounts for 95% of the total transaction cost.
* A key driver of this cost reduction is the introduction of Volition, Starknet's mechanism for a hybrid Data Availability (DA) mode that allows both on-chain and off-chain data.
* In addition to Volition, Starknet plans to leverage Ethereum's EIP-4844 (Shard Blob Transaction), anticipated for release in Q4 of 2023. This Ethereum improvement proposal is expected to further help reduce the cost of data.

In line with Starknet's principle of transparent and open communication, more details about these developments will be shared as they emerge.

== Beyond v0.13.0

While the immediate focus is on performance and transaction costs, Starknet's roadmap extends beyond these areas. Future developments will be directed by the requirements and feedback of the Starknet community, upholding the network's dedication to a developer-focused approach.

* Cairo, Starknet's powerful programming language, will continue to receive enhancements, making it an ever more effective tool for developers.
* Decentralization is another key aspect of Starknet's future developments, with plans to further decentralize the various components of the network, including the Prover and the Sequencer.
* The Starknet Foundation will play a pivotal role in the governance of these initiatives, ensuring that the network continues to grow in a manner that is in the best interest of its community.

Detailed timelines and updates will be provided regularly to ensure that the community is informed about the progress and direction of Starknet.
