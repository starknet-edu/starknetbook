= Deploying Starknet contracts

In this chapter, you will learn to compile, deploy and interact with a Starknet contract written in Cairo.

Follow the below steps in order to accomplish your goal!

== Setting up environment variables

The following commands must run every time you open a new terminal to interact with Starknet. Setting them saves you time when using the CLI within the same terminal session.

[source, bash]
----
# Use Starknet testnet
export STARKNET_NETWORK=alpha-goerli
# Set the default wallet implementation to be used by the CLI
export STARKNET_WALLET=starkware.starknet.wallets.open_zeppelin.OpenZeppelinAccount
# Set the path to the cairo 1 compiler binary. Adapt this path to fit your installation if needed
export CAIRO_COMPILER_DIR=~/.cairo/target/release/
# Compiler arguments
export CAIRO_COMPILER_ARGS=--add-pythonic-hints
----

== Setting up an account

You need to set up your CLI with an account contract and fund it.

[NOTE]
====
Starknet accounts are smart contracts. As such, creating one involves sending a transaction, and takes a bit longer than creating an EOA on other networks.
You can learn more in the https://docs.starknet.io/documentation/architecture_and_concepts/Account_Abstraction/introduction/[accounts] section of the documentation.
====

This process will involve three steps:

* Generating your account address locally
* Funding it
* Deploying it

The Starknet account declared through the CLI are stored on your machine in folder `~/.starknet_accounts/`.

[source, bash]
----
# Creating a new account.
starknet new_account --account account_name
----

Your terminal will return your account's address.

[source, bash]
----
Account address: 0x00d9d851f600d539a9f7811de4d9613a6b3c2634f8c0386a305c03216bd67559
Public key: 0x0293d6625d860b9a37a0319d1e3c1eecc27685075cbeaae4ef29ed717d93c58b
Move the appropriate amount of funds to the account, and then deploy the account
by invoking the 'starknet deploy_account' command.

NOTE: This is a modified version of the OpenZeppelin account contract. The signature is computed
differently.
----

Next step is to fund it. Use one of the following methods:

* Use the https://faucet.goerli.starknet.io[faucet] to get some funds and send them to the account
* Bridge funds using https://goerli.starkgate.starknet.io/[Starkgate]

However you chose to do it, please make sure that the funding transaction reaches the "PENDING" status before moving on. You can look for it on https://testnet.starkscan.co/[Starkscan] or https://goerli.voyager.online/[Voyager]

[source, bash]
----
# Deploying your account
starknet deploy_account --account account_name
----

Your sample output should look something like this:

[source, bash]
----
Sending the transaction with max_fee: 0.000568 ETH (568383605914463 WEI).
Sent deploy account contract transaction.
Contract address: 0x03f42fc2355be54197a8b270ff2cb8e2eb7902e777b3498f8ad58c6c147cce60
Transaction hash: 0x3d15e05389ecd1ff65555220be57f0ab43729877b20ca086048276917ed2838
----

Monitor the transaction until it passes the "PENDING" state.

== Create and compile a contract

Before we get started, make sure that the below commands are working properly on your system. If
they don't, please check the xref:chapter_1:environment_setup.adoc[Setting up your environment]
section.

[source, bash]
----
starknet --version
starknet-compile  --version
----

You can now create a folder of your choice (in any location) where you would like to practice
your Cairo skills . Inside the new folder, create a file name `hello_starknet.cairo`.

[source, bash]
----
#Create a new folder for practicing your cairo skills
cd ~/
mkdir cairo_practice && cd cairo_practice

#Create a new file called hello_starknet.cairo
touch hello_starknet.cairo
----

Copy and paste the following piece of code into your `hello_starknet.cairo` file:

[source, rust]
----
#[contract]
mod HelloStarknet {
    use starknet::get_caller_address;
    use starknet::ContractAddress;

    #[event]
    fn Hello(from:ContractAddress, value:felt252) {}

    #[external]
    fn say_hello(message:felt252) {
        let caller=get_caller_address();
        Hello(caller, message);
    }
}
----

Customize the above code by adding a new type of event. Find a name that is unique (this is important).
Add the following code:

[source, rust]
----
    #[event]
    fn My_Unique_Event_Name(from:ContractAddress, value:felt252) {}
----

Compile the above Starknet contract using the following command:

[source, bash]
----
starknet-compile hello_starknet.cairo hello_starknet.json
----

The above command should compile to produce a `hello_starknet.json` file  in the same folder.

== Declare a contract class

On Starknet, the deployment process is in two steps:

* Declaring the class of your contract, or sending your contract's code to the network
* Deploying a contract, or creating an instance of the code you previously declared

Let's start with declaring the above code.

[source, bash]
----
starknet declare --contract hello_starknet.json --account account_name
----

[NOTE]
====
The above command may fail if you are using code that has already been declared by someone else! Please make sure to add custom code to your contract to create a new contract class.
====

You will see something like (if you get an error, see the next section on troubleshooting):

[source, bash]
----
Sending the transaction with max_fee: 0.000132 ETH (131904173791637 WEI).
Declare transaction was sent.
Contract class hash: 0x8ceb9796d2809438d1e992b8ac17cfe83d0cf5944dbad948a370e0b5d5924f
Transaction hash: 0x334f16d9da30913c4a30194057793379079f35efa6bf5753bc6e724a591e9f0
----
The transaction hash allows you to track when the network will have received your contract's code. Once this transaction has moved to "PENDING", you can deploy an instance of your contract.

=== Troubleshooting: Contract Declaration Process

In the contract declaration process, you may encounter hiccups due to diverse factors such as software compatibility, architectural discrepancies, and execution errors.

Here is an error that can arise during the contract declaration:

[source,bash]
----
Error: OSError: [Errno 8] Exec format error: '/opt/homebrew/lib/python3.9/site-packages/starkware/starknet/compiler/v1/bin/starknet-sierra-compile'
----

This error is generated when cairo-lang attempts to compile your Sierra code using an imported Rust binary, 'starknet-sierra-compile'. However, in some instances, the imported binary may not be compatible with your system architecture.

The solution is to replace the incompatible Rust binary with a locally built version. The following steps can guide you through this process:

. *Build the 'starknet-sierra-compile' binary locally.* We did this before when we set up our environment by cloning the starknet repository and building the binary. If you have not done this yet, please refer to the Setting Up Your Environment subchapter.

. *Replace the incompatible binary in the Python package.* The locally built 'starknet-sierra-compile' binary can be moved into the Python package directory. Here's an example of how to do this:

[source,bash]
----
cp ~/.cairo/target/release/starknet-sierra-compile /opt/homebrew/lib/python3.9/site-packages/starkware/starknet/compiler/v1/bin/starknet-sierra-compile
----

. *Retry the contract declaration.* After replacing the binary, try declaring your contract again. The process should work without any issues.

This section is by no means exhaustive, and it is possible to encounter a multitude of different issues during the contract declaration process. When facing issues, remember to check for any updates or changes in the documentation and don't hesitate to add an issue on the starknet book repository.

== Deploy a contract

Using the above generated class hash, deploy the contract:

[source, bash]
----
starknet deploy --class_hash 0x8ceb9796d2809438d1e992b8ac17cfe83d0cf5944dbad948a370e0b5d5924f --account account_name
----

[NOTE]
====
If you run into any fee related issues, please add the flag  `--max_fee 100000000000000000` to your CLI commands to set an arbitrary high gas limit for your deploy transaction.
====

You will see something like:

[source, bash]
----
Sending the transaction with max_fee: 0.000197 ETH (197273405375932 WEI).
Invoke transaction for contract deployment was sent.
Contract address: 0x03a5cac216edec20350e1fd8369536fadebb20b83bfceb0c33aab0175574d35d
Transaction hash: 0x7895267b3e967e1c9c2f7da145e323bed60dfdd1b8ecc8efd243c9d587d579a
----

Monitor the deploy transaction. Once it has passed "PENDING", your contract has been successfully
deployed!

Wohooo! You have just deployed your first Cairo 1.0 contract on Starknet! Congratulations.

== Interact with your contract

If you quickly browse through the above contract (`hello_starknet.cairo`), you can see the
contract has a simple function: `say_hello` which we are going to learn to trigger.

[source, rust]
----
#Function that we will be invoking
#[external]
fn say_hello(message:felt252) {
    let caller=get_caller_address();
    Hello(caller, message);
}
----

The syntax to invoke a function in your contract is:

[source, bash]
----
starknet invoke --function <name of the function> --address <address of the deployed contract> --account <account_name>

# Invoking our say_hello function
starknet invoke --function say_hello --address 0x03a5cac216edec20350e1fd8369536fadebb20b83bfceb0c33aab0175574d35d --input 152  --account account_name
----

You will see something like:

[source, bash]
----
Sending the transaction with max_fee: 0.000080 ETH (79590795788372 WEI).
Invoke transaction was sent.
Contract address: 0x03a5cac216edec20350e1fd8369536fadebb20b83bfceb0c33aab0175574d35d
Transaction hash: 0xbfb3ec183b4ee58db67113cf8832c31e78fe8000f091cc598d5aa9ca6a62af
