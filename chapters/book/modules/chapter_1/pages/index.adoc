= Introduction to Starknet

Welcome to the Starknet Book. This is your roadmap to Starknet's key features, its core philosophy, and its unique language, Cairo. Whether you're a developer, a crypto fan, or just curious, this book is your starting point.

== What is Starknet?

Starknet is a Layer-2 network that makes Ethereum transactions faster, cheaper, and more secure using zk-STARKs technology. Think of it as a boosted layer on top of Ethereum, optimized for speed and cost.

=== Key Features

These are some key features of Starknet:

* Low Costs: Transactions on Starknet cost less than on Ethereum. Future updates like Volition and EIP 4844 will make it even cheaper.
* Developer-Friendly: Starknet lets developers easily build decentralized apps using its native language, Cairo.
* Speed and Efficiency: Upcoming releases aim to make transactions even faster and cheaper.
* CVM: Thanks to Cairo, Starknet runs on it´s own VM, called Cairo VM (CVM), that allow us to innovate beyond the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and create a new paradigm for decentralized applications. 

Here some of them:

* Account Abstraction: Implemented at the protocol level, this facilitates diverse signing schemes while ensuring user security and self-custody of assets.
* Volition: Will be implemented on testnet during Q4 2023 will allow developers to regulate data availability on Ethereum (L1) or on Starknet (L2). Reducing L1 onchain data can radically reduce costs.
* Paymaster: StarkNet will allow users to choose how to pay for transaction fee, follows the guidelines laid out in EIP 4337 and allows the transaction to specify a specific contract, a *Paymaster*, to pay for their transaction. Supports gasless transactions, enhancing user accessibility.

== Starknet Philosophy: Built for Developers

Starknet is all about being developer-friendly. It's a high-performance platform designed to make building decentralized apps easier and more powerful. Here are its pillars:

* Speed and Cost: Fast transactions and low fees make it ideal for resource-heavy apps.
* Cairo: This evolving language makes it easier to use validity proofs and zk-STARKs tech.
* Community: Active communication with developers through Telegram and Discord.
* Freedom: No more tech limitations. Build what you've always wanted.
* Tools: A full suite of dev tools, including multiple SDKs and testing frameworks.

This philosophy drives Starknet's roadmap.

== Cairo: The Language of Starknet

Cairo is tailor-made for creating STARK-based smart contracts. As Starknet’s native language, it’s central to building scalable and secure decentralized apps. To start learning now, check out the https://cairo-book.github.io/[Cairo Book] and https://github.com/shramee/starklings-cairo1[Starklings].

Inspired by Rust, Cairo lets you write contracts safely and conveniently.

=== Why Choose Cairo?

Cairo is designed for 'Provable Computation,' a new paradigm that lets programs prove their correctness without re-running them. Here’s why it stands out:

* Purpose-Built: Designed specifically for smart contracts.
* No EVM Limits: Goes beyond what the Ethereum Virtual Machine can do.
* Flexibility: Uses traits for more flexibility than inheritance.

== Governance

The Starknet Foundation oversees Starknet’s governance. Its duties include:

* Managing Starknet’s development and operations
* Overseeing the Starknet DAO, which enables community involvement
* Setting rules to maintain network integrity

Our focus is on technical input and debate for improving the protocol. While we value all perspectives, it's often the technical insights that steer us forward.

Members can influence Starknet by voting on changes. Here’s the process: A new version is tested on the Goerli Testnet. Members then have six days to review it. A Snapshot proposal is made, and the community votes. A majority of 'YES' votes means an upgrade to the Mainnet.

In short, governance is key to Starknet’s evolution.

To propose an improvement, create a SNIP.

=== SNIP: StarkNet Improvement Proposals

SNIP is short for StarkNet Improvement Proposal. It's essentially a blueprint that details proposed enhancements or changes to the StarkNet ecosystem. A well-crafted SNIP includes both the technical specifications of the change and the reasons behind it. If you're proposing a SNIP, it's your job to rally community support and document any objections (more details https://community.starknet.io/t/draft-simp-1-simp-purpose-and-guidelines/1197#what-is-a-snip-2[here]). Once a SNIP is approved, it becomes a part of the Starknet protocol. All the SNIPs can be found in https://github.com/starknet-io/SNIPs[this repository].

SNIPs serve three crucial roles:

1. They are the main avenue for proposing new features or changes.
2. They act as a platform for technical discussions within the community.
3. They document the decision-making process, offering a historical view of how StarkNet has evolved.

Because SNIPs are stored as text files in a https://github.com/starknet-io/SNIPs[version-controlled repository], you can easily track changes and understand the history of proposals.

For those who are building on Starknet, SNIPs aren't just suggestions—they're a roadmap. It's beneficial for implementers to keep a list of the SNIPs they've executed. This transparency helps users gauge the state of a particular implementation or software library.

== Development

The Starknet Foundation actively nurtures the ecosystem by:

* Supporting research and development
* Promoting Starknet technology adoption
* Funding and organizing conferences and events for knowledge sharing

=== Community Engagement

Community strength matters to the Foundation. To foster engagement, it:

* Organizes events and discussions
* Collaborates with allied blockchain communities
* Creates avenues for community contributions to Starknet’s growth

== What is Starkware?

Starkware, founded in 2018, focuses on zk-STARK technology. Its key products include:

* StarkEx: A Layer 2 solution on Ethereum, efficient through STARK proofs
* Cairo: An open-source language for efficient, scalable computation in decentralized apps (https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo/tree/73c3ed0a1af65f53490866426ae49360b2304374[see repo])

Starknet, its latest project, aims for community-driven evolution under the Starknet Foundation’s governance.

== Conclusion

Starknet offers scalable, secure, and cost-effective decentralized apps, backed by zk-STARKs technology. It’s not just the tech; Starknet puts emphasis on empowering its developer community with robust tools and resources. This book aims to guide all those keen to explore Starknet’s technologies and philosophies.
