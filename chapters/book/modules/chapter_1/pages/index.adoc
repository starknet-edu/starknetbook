== What is Starknet?

Starknet is a permissionless network that leverages the power of zk-STARKs technology for scalability, privacy, and security. As a Layer-2 scalability solution for Ethereum, Starknet offers fast, secure, and low-cost transactions. It functions as a Validity Rollup (commonly known as a zero-knowledge Rollup) that uses cryptographic systems called STARKs to reduce computation costs.

Critical features of Starknet include:

* Low transaction costs: Starknet’s transaction costs are significantly lower than Ethereum’s. With forthcoming upgrades and enhancements such as Volition (off-chain data availability) and the implementation of EIP 4844 on L1, these transaction costs are expected to decrease even further.
* Developer-friendly platform: Starknet provides an environment that empowers developers to build decentralized applications using STARKs and the Cairo programming language.
* High throughput and low latency: Starknet’s upcoming releases aim to increase the network’s throughput, reduce transaction latency, and lower transaction costs.

=== The Starknet Philosophy: A Developer-friendly Approach

Starknet’s philosophy is centered around being developer-friendly. The network is designed with a clear focus on providing developers with a robust, secure, and powerful platform for building the future of decentralized infrastructure and applications. Fundamental principles of this approach include:

* Performance: Starknet offers faster throughput, lower latency, and reduced transaction costs, thus facilitating the creation of compute-intensive applications.
* Cairo: Starknet’s core programming language, Cairo, is constantly updated and enhanced to provide developers with the best tools for leveraging validity proofs and zk-STARKs technology.
* Community focus: Starknet maintains active communication channels and feedback with the developer community via platforms like Telegram and Discord.
* Creativity: Starknet aims to remove limitations and empower developers to build the future of decentralized applications. Build things that have never been built before just because of the limitations of the underlying technology. 
* Tooling: Starknet is committed to providing a comprehensive suite of development tools, including SDKs for various languages, a testing and deployment framework inspired by Foundry (Protostar), and package managers (Scarb).

The philosophy of Starknet is materialized with its roadmap, which is discussed in the next section.

== What is Cairo?

Cairo is a Turing-complete programming language designed for creating STARK-provable programs for general computation. As the native smart contract language for Starknet, a permissionless Validity Roll-up, Cairo plays a crucial role in enabling scalable and secure decentralized applications. During the Smart Contracts Chapter of the Book, we will explore Cairo in more detail. Several resources exist to learn about Cairo, including the https://cairo-book.github.io/[Cairo Book] and https://github.com/shramee/starklings-cairo1[Starklings].

Cairo is inspired by the Rust programming language. It allows developers to write Starknet smart contracts in a safe, convenient, and familiar manner.

=== Why Cairo?

Starknet's scalability solution, Validity rollups, introduces a new paradigm called Provable Computation. This approach allows programs to prove their correct execution without needing to be re-run. To develop such provable programs, a specialized programming language that is both effective and easily learnable by developers is necessary.

Some benefits of Cairo include:

* Specially designed as a provable language for smart contracts
* Unbounded by the limitations of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)
* Utilizes traits for a more loosely-coupled relationship compared to inheritance

== What is the Starknet Foundation?

The Starknet Foundation serves as the steward of Starknet, ensuring that the network remains accountable to its community of developers and users. As a non-profit organization, it carries out several key roles in the ecosystem.

=== Governance

The Foundation is responsible for the governance of Starknet. Its governance duties involve:

* Overseeing the development and operations of Starknet, including network upgrades and improvements.
* Regulating the Starknet DAO, a decentralized autonomous organization that facilitates community participation in Starknet’s governance.
* Establishing rules and regulations to ensure fair practices and maintain the integrity of the network.

=== Development

Beyond governance, the Starknet Foundation also plays an active role in fostering development within the Starknet ecosystem:

* The Foundation supports and facilitates research, development, and innovation in the Starknet network and the broader Starknet ecosystem.
* It champions the expansion of Starknet technology and promotes the adoption of the Starknet network.
* The Foundation provides financial and logistical support for user and developer conferences and events, fostering collaboration and knowledge sharing within the community.

=== Community Engagement

The Starknet Foundation recognizes the importance of a strong, vibrant community in the success of Starknet. It takes several measures to fuel Starknet community participation and project governance:

* The Foundation is deeply involved in organizing and facilitating community events, meetups, and discussions.
* It encourages collaboration with allied and related communities, nurturing a sense of unity and shared purpose among those involved in the broader blockchain space.
* The Foundation makes efforts to create opportunities for community members to contribute to the growth and development of Starknet, be it through development, governance, or community building.

=== Board of Directors

A board of seven directors oversees the governance of the Starknet Foundation, each contributing unique expertise to the table. These directors come from diverse backgrounds and bring a wide array of insights and perspectives:

* Andrew McLaughlin: Specializes in tech policy, digital rights, and community self-governance. He brings his entrepreneurial experience to the Foundation’s governance.

== What is Starkware?

Starkware is a technology company in the blockchain industry that focuses on developing and deploying zk-STARK technology. Starkware was founded in 2018, and since then, it has been at the forefront of the advancement of STARK-based technologies in the blockchain industry.

Starkware’s first key innovation was StarkEx, which, based on a Software as a Service (SaaS) business model, has become one of the most significant Layer 2 solutions in production on Ethereum since its inception in June 2020. It has achieved this through leveraging STARK proofs, which ensure the validity of large batches of transactions processed off-chain with a minimal on-chain footprint.

Starkware’s second significant contribution to the blockchain industry is Cairo, a programming language optimized for writing efficient STARK proofs, enabling scalable computation for decentralized applications. With its efficiency and Turing completeness, Cairo became a vital tool for developers, both off-chain and on Starknet.

Starknet, which is Starkware’s latest accomplishment, represents a significant leap in the field of Layer 2 solutions. Starkware decided to establish Starknet as a permissionless, decentralized network governed by the Starknet Foundation. The goal is to ensure that Starknet becomes a community-driven project where many entities contribute to its evolution and development.
