= On-Chain Artificial Intelligence

The advent of higher transactions per second (TPS) on Starknet has sparked a transformation in the realm of artificial intelligence (AI). It is becoming increasingly conceivable to integrate AI into our digital existence on-chain, an endeavor that could have multiple advantages, such as verifiable inference and training, and on-chain model ensembles. All of these are predicated on the availability of cheap computation. 

Teams like Giza and Modulus Labs are engaged in pioneering research to bring AI on-chain using Zero-Knowledge (ZK) proofs. One of the exciting outcomes of this work is Orion, a Cairo library for Validity ML.

== Validity ML and Orion: Building Trust in AI

Validity ML uses validity proofs like STARKs, allowing the verification of computational process correctness. By incorporating these proof systems into ML applications, it's possible to authenticate private data with public models and vice versa. Thus, a trustless and transparent ML ecosystem is emerging, in which we can trustlessly prove and verify sources and traces of inference.

Orion, an exciting outcome of this research, offers a new ONNX runtime built in Cairo. Leveraging Cairo and ONNX's capabilities, Orion provides a transparent, verifiable, and wholly open-source inference framework, accessible for community contribution and use. Its goal is to provide a runtime implementation for verifiable ML model inferences using STARKs, ensuring reliable inferences with Cairo.

A Call to Developers: The frontier of on-chain AI is expansive and inviting. As we traverse this exciting landscape, we welcome more developers to explore and contribute to this pioneering space. Whether with Orion or other tools, your expertise and innovative ideas are valuable in creating a transparent, verifiable, and community-driven AI ecosystem. This is an open invitation to help shape the future of AI, making it more accessible, reliable, and beneficial for all.

== Orion's Capabilities

Orion offers three distinct APIs: Operators, Numbers, and Performance, each contributing to create a well-rounded, effective environment for developing machine learning models on-chain.

*Operators API* provides a comprehensive set of standard mathematical functions and operations specifically designed for computing neural network models and compatible with ONNX standard.

*Numbers API* extends Cairo's built-in number capabilities by introducing Signed-Integer and Fixed-Point implementations. By incorporating these features, developers can work with a wider range of numeric data types, allowing for more accurate calculations in their applications.

*Performance API* contains a set of functions to optimize the performance of your model. The initial release supports 8-bit quantization, which reduces the memory footprint and accelerates the computation time of your models, allowing you to build more efficient and faster ML applications without sacrificing accuracy.
