= Starknet Hardhat Plugin

Hardhat is a popular JS development environment for Ethereum, and if you are already familiar with it and want to use it on Starknet, then this plugin will come in handy!

== Getting Started

Follow these high-level steps to get started with the Starknet Hardhat Plugin:

* Install Hardhat itself (https://hardhat.org/tutorial/creating-a-new-hardhat-project[check this official guide])
* Include the https://github.com/0xSpaceShard/starknet-hardhat-plugin[Hardhat plugin] inside the Hardhat project you created, per instructions in the https://0xspaceshard.github.io/starknet-hardhat-plugin[documentation].
* Create a new project (in our case, we called it hardhat-tutorial) 
* Navigate to the newly created project
* Be sure to run:

[source, bash]
----
npm i @shardlabs/starknet-hardhat-plugin --save-dev
----

* After successfully installing everything, make sure you have docker running as well, or if you have `cairo-lang` installed locally, you can set up venv in your hardhat config file - like https://0xspaceshard.github.io/starknet-hardhat-plugin/docs/intro#existing-virtual-environment[this]!

* Next, add the following line to the top of your `hardhat.config.ts` (or `hardhat.config.js):

[source, bash]
----
import "@shardlabs/starknet-hardhat-plugin";
----

Or:

[source, bash]
----
require("@shardlabs/starknet-hardhat-plugin");
----

== Using the Plugin

With this setup, you can now run Starknet CLI commands as tasks in Hardhat. For instance, to compile a Cairo contract, execute:

[source, bash]
----
npx hardhat starknet-compile-cairo1 [PATH...] 
----

== Example

[NOTE]
====
TODO: We would love to see a simple example of how to use the plugin. If you have one, please submit a PR!

In the meantime, you can check the the OxSpaceShard example repository https://github.com/0xSpaceShard/starknet-hardhat-example[here]. The repository contains examples of the capacities of the plugin. You can check the `/scripts` folder with various scenarios.
