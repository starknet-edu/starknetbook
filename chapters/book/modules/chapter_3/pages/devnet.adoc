= Devnet

Transactions on the testnet take time to complete, so it's best to start developing and testing locally. We will use the https://github.com/Shard-Labs/starknet-devnet[devnet developed by Shard Labs]. We can think of this step as an equivalent of Ganache. That is, it emulates the testnet (alpha goerli) of Starknet.

Install using:

[,Bash]
----
pip install starknet-devnet
----

Restart your terminal and run `starknet-devnet --version` to check that the installation was successful. Check that you have https://github.com/Shard-Labs/starknet-devnet/releases[the most up-to-date version]. If you don't have it, run `pip install --upgrade starknet-devnet`. https://shard-labs.github.io/starknet-devnet/docs/intro[Here is the documentation].

Initialize the devnet in a separate shell (or tab) with

[,Bash]
----
starknet-devnet \
    --accounts 3 \
    --gas-price 250 \
    --seed 0 \
    --port 5000
----

We get:

[,Bash]

Initial balance of each account: 1000000000000000000000 WEI
Seed to replicate this account sequence: 0
WARNING: Use these accounts and their keys ONLY for local testing. DO NOT use them on the mainnet or live networks because you will LOSE FUNDS.

 * Listening on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
----

We can run `+curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/is_alive+` to check if the devnet is active. You will receive `Alive!!!%` if it is active.

We created three accounts, with transaction costs of 250 wei per gas. The seed number will help us get the same accounts every time we activate our devnet and add that seed number. In other words, we can choose any seed number, but if we want to get the same accounts, we should select the same seed. We indicated we want to use port `5000`, however, feel free to add any convenient port. Our accounts are based on the code and standards developed by https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/cairo-contracts[Open Zepellin for Cairo].

Please keep track of the address where our devnet is running. The example above is: `+http://127.0.0.1:5000+`. We will use it later.

The interaction with the devnet and the testnet is very similar. If you want to see all the arguments available in the `starknet-devnet` call, you can call `starknet-devnet --help` or go to the https://shard-labs.github.io/starknet-devnet/docs/intro[documentation].
