= Protostar

https://docs.swmansion.com/protostar/[Protostar] is a highly practical development platform for the Starknet universe. This tool eases the process of managing dependencies, compiling projects, running tests, and interacting with the Starknet chain. Protostar allows developers to write, test and deploy their Cairo contracts in a streamlined manner.

== Installation

To begin, you'll need to install Protostar on your local machine. This process currently supports Linux and MacOS systems (Windows support is in progress).

Install Protostar by opening a terminal and running the following command:

[source,bash]
----
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/software-mansion/protostar/master/install.sh | bash
----

After the installation process, restart the terminal. Check that the version of your installed Protostar matches the https://github.com/software-mansion/protostar/releases[most recent version]. If it does not, update your Protostar version using the command:

[source,bash]
----
# Check your current version
protostar -v

# Update to the latest version
protostar upgrade
----

== Supported Software Versions

Ensure you're keeping your Protostar upgraded to the latest version.

Protostar doesn't currently support Windows. 

== Verifying Installation

Once Protostar is installed, verify it by checking the version with the command:

[source,bash]
----
protostar -v
----

The output should be as follows:

[source,bash]
----
Protostar version: 0.13.0                                                                                                       
Cairo-lang version: 0.11.1.1
Cairo 1 compiler version: 1.1.0
----

Note that Cairo-lang is the version of the Starknet network and Cairo 1 compiler is the version of the Cairo compiler.

== Initiating a New Cairo Project

After successful installation and verification of Protostar, initiate a new project by running:

[source,bash]
----
protostar init my_project
cd my_project
----

The structure of your project directory should be similar to:

[source,bash]
----
my_project/
.
├── Scarb.toml
├── protostar.toml
├── src
│   ├── business_logic
│   │   └── utils.cairo
│   ├── business_logic.cairo
│   ├── contract
│   │   └── hello_starknet.cairo
│   ├── contract.cairo
│   └── lib.cairo
└── tests
    ├── test_hello_starknet.cairo
    └── test_utils.cairo
----

The most important thing to notice is how we have structured both these contracts as standalone crates. Each smart contract in Protostar must be built as its own crate and each contract is its own module decorated with the `[contract]` decorator.

Explore the official Protostar documentation for more details on structuring your project: https://docs.swmansion.com/protostar/docs/cairo-1/introduction

Protostar uses Scarb and its manifest files to manage dependencies in your project. In order to use Protostar with Cairo 1, you must have Scarb executable added to the PATH environment variable. The PATH variable is a list of directories that your system searches for executables. It is practically the main goal of Scarb within a Protostar project; compiling can be done with Scarb, but Protostar will do it for you.

== Structure of a Cairo Project

A Cairo project includes several crucial components that help create and manage a smart contract. Let's explore each part in detail.

=== Cairo Packages

Cairo packages, also referred to as "crates" in some contexts, are the building blocks of a Cairo project. Each package must follow several rules:

* A package must include a `Scarb.toml` file, which is Scarb's manifest file. It contains the dependencies for your package.
* A package must include a `src/lib.cairo` file, which is the root of the package tree. It allows you to define functions and declare used modules.

Package structures might look like the following:

[source,bash]
----
my_package/
├── src/
│   ├── module1.cairo
│   ├── module2.cairo
│   └── lib.cairo
└── Scarb.toml
----

Within the `Scarb.toml` file, you might have:

[source,toml]
----
[package]
name = "my_package"
version = "0.1.0"

[dependencies]
other_package = { path = "../other_package" }
----

=== Protostar and Scarb: Working Together

Protostar and Scarb are both instrumental in managing a Cairo project. While Scarb primarily handles dependencies, Protostar manages project compilation, testing, and interaction with the Starknet chain. 

Scarb is a tool for managing dependencies in your Cairo packages. When you use Protostar with Cairo 1, you need to have the Scarb executable added to your `PATH` environment variable. `PATH` is a list of directories that your system searches for executables.

Protostar, on the other hand, uses Scarb and its manifest files to compile your project. Even though Scarb could technically handle this process independently, Protostar streamlines it for you, making the entire process more manageable and efficient.

== The protostar.toml File

The `protostar.toml` file is a configuration file located at the root of your project. It defines several key attributes for your project, such as the version of Protostar to be used, contract names, configuration profiles, and command-specific configurations.

Here's an example of what a `protostar.toml` file might look like:

[source,toml]
----
[project]
protostar-version = "PROTOSTAR_VERSION"

[contracts]
hello_starknet = ["hello_starknet"]

[profile.integration.test]
target = ["tests/integration"]
report-slowest-tests = 5

[profile.devnet.project]
gateway-url = "http://127.0.0.1:5050/"
chain-id = 1536727068981429685321

[profile.testnet.project]
network = "testnet"
----

Each section within the `protostar.toml` file has its specific function:

* `[project]` section: This allows you to specify global options and settings for your project, such as the Protostar version (`protostar-version`).
* `[contracts]` section: This defines the packages containing contracts to be used by Protostar commands.
* `Command Arguments Configuration Section`: This section allows you to specify arguments for a specific Protostar command.
* `Configuration Profiles`: Configuration profiles allow you to easily switch between different Protostar configurations.

Overall, the `protostar.toml` file plays an essential role in managing project settings and configurations, contributing to a smoother development process.


== Testing Contracts

In the realm of Cairo smart contracts, there are two predominant ways to test your contracts: within Cairo itself, or with Python, Javascript, or Rust. 

The Cairo approach is often preferred, as it prevents developers from having to deploy contracts each time they need to be tested and eliminates the necessity of learning a new language for testing purposes.

Execute tests using the command:

[source,bash]
----
protostar test
----

A successful test execution will provide an output resembling:

[source,bash]
----
Collected 2 suites, and 3 test cases (11.32)                                                                                                                    
[PASS] tests/test_utils.cairo test_returns_two (time=0.00s)                                                                                                     
[PASS] tests/test_hello_starknet.cairo test_increase_balance (time=25.81s)                                                                                      
[PASS] tests/test_hello_starknet.cairo test_cannot_increase_balance_with_zero_value (time=25.19s)

== Compile the Project

== Project Compilation

Before a project can be deployed on the network, it must be compiled into a form that the Starknet network can understand and execute. Protostar makes this process easy with its `build` command. 

To compile your Cairo1 project, use the build command:

[source,bash]
----
protostar build
----

If your compilation was successful, the output will be similar to this:

[source,bash]
----
21:00:22 [INFO] Building cairo1 contracts                                                                                                                       
21:00:27 [INFO] Contracts built successfully
21:00:27 [INFO] Execution time: 6.22 s
----

== Contract Declaration

After successfully compiling your project, the next step is to declare your contracts. This process informs the network of your intention to deploy a new contract (review Chapter 2 for more details on the contract declaration process).

Before declaring contracts, it's essential to first set the environment variable for your private key:

[source,bash]
----
export PROTOSTAR_ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY=0x...
----

You can then declare your contracts with the following command:

[source,bash]
----
protostar declare hello_starknet \
  --network testnet \
  --account-address YOUR_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS \
  --max-fee auto
----

Note: Replace `YOUR_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS` with your actual account address.

Successful declaration will generate a class hash and output similar to:

[source,bash]
----
Declare transaction was sent.

21:01:23 [INFO] Execution time: 27.95 s
----

== Contract Deployment

After declaring your contract, the next step is to deploy it on the network. Deployment makes your contract live and interactable on the Starknet.

To deploy your contract, use the class hash generated from the declaration step and the `protostar deploy` command:

[source,bash]
----
protostar deploy \
  0x04ad47b818e8811a8c1df2a03a26381da0232bb7da3cba274831c2cfc9953acd \
  --network testnet \
  --account-address YOUR_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS \
  --max-fee auto
----

Note: Replace `YOUR_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS` with your actual account address. 

The '0x' address following the deploy command is the Class Hash that was generated during contract declaration.

Successful deployment will provide a contract address and output similar to this:

[source,bash]
----
Invoke transaction was sent to the Universal Deployer Contract.                                                                                                 
Contract address: 0x02341c459847cf220671ab873e14d853197c74e239c3b5815b0aa2e85bc37ebd

== A Simple Demo 

To learn how you can get started with Protostar, let's create a simple project. First, navigate to your terminal and execute:

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/SupremeSingh/protostar-cairo1-template.git
cd protostar-cairo1-template
----

Now, you have access to a basic Protostar project that implements two smart contracts along with additional business logic in `Cairo 1.0`. Before proceeding, it's advisable to familiarize yourself with the code in both `erc20.cairo` and `hello_starknet.cairo`. 

For a deeper understanding of testing, it is highly recommended to examine the tests in `tests/test_erc20.cairo` and compare them with the original contract in `contracts/erc20.cairo`.

== Debugging

For code debugging, it's beneficial to be able to print out values or isolate errors in match statements. Protostar already provides these functionalities. 

To print out values, use the following:

[source,bash]
----
use array::ArrayTrait;
use array::ArrayTCloneImpl;
use array::SpanTrait;
use debug::PrintTrait;
use clone::Clone;

array.span().snapshot.clone().print(); // Print an array value
felt.print() // Print an individual value
----

You can also use match statements like so: 

[source,bash]
----
match invoke(deployed_contract_address, 'panic_with', @panic_data) {
    Result::Ok(x) => assert(false, 'Shouldnt have succeeded'),
    Result::Err(x) => {
        assert(x.first() == 'error', 'first datum doesnt match');
        assert(*x.panic_data.at(1_u32) == 'data', 'second datum doesntmatch');
    }
}
----

Finally, to make your code interact with Starknet, you can utilize the comprehensive list of commands provided by Protostar. You can find these commands [here](https://docs.swmansion.com/protostar/docs/cairo-1/interacting-with-starknet).

== Common Gotchas 

- Each test should be named `test_<further name>.cairo` so that the framework can recognize it.
- Tests need to be decorated with `#[test]`, be without parameters, and include an assertion.
- `contract_address_const::<0>()` is the default caller for all invocations.
- A `Prank` needs to be used to change the caller address.
- `u256` values need to be split into two `felt252` values when making a call.
- Protostar currently does not support `#[external]` functions that emit an event for testing. Please wait for the next release.

== Conclusion

Protostar represents a powerful toolset for developing, testing, and deploying smart contracts on the Starknet network. This guide has introduced you to its main features and demonstrated how to use it in the context of a simple project. Although there are some nuances and "gotchas" to be aware of, the benefits of using Protostar are evident. As the Starknet ecosystem evolves, tools like Protostar will continue to play a critical role in helping developers build robust, reliable, and secure decentralized applications. Happy coding!
