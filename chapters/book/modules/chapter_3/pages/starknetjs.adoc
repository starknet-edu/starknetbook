= Starknet.js - Starknet JavaScript SDK

Starknet.js is a JavaScript/TypeScript library designed to connect your website or decentralized application (D-App) to Starknet. It aims to mimic the architecture of https://docs.ethers.org/v5/[ethers.js], so if you are familiar with ethers, you should find Starknet.js easy to work with.

== Installation

To install Starknet.js, follow these steps:

* For the latest official release (main branch):

[source, bash]
----
npm install starknet
----

* To use the latest features (merges in develop branch):

[source, bash]
----
npm install starknet@next
----

== Getting Started

To build an app that users are able to connect to and interact with Starknet, we recommend adding the https://github.com/starknet-io/get-starknet[get-starknet] library, which allows you to manage wallet connections. 

With these tools ready, there are basically 3 main concepts to know on the frontend: Account, Provider, and Contracts.

### Account
We can generally think of the account as the "end user" of a dapp, and some user interaction will be involved to gain access to it. 

Think of a dapp where the user connects their browser extension wallet (such as ArgentX or Braavos) - if the user accepts the connection, that gives us access to the account and signer, which can sign transactions and messages.

Unlike Ethereum, where user accounts are Externally Owned Accounts, Starknet **accounts are contracts**. This might not necessarily impact your dapp's frontend, but you should definitely be aware of this difference.

```ts
async function connectWallet() {
    const starknet = await connect();
    console.log(starknet.account);
    
    const nonce = await starknet.account.getNonce();
    const message = await starknet.account.signMessage(...)
}
```
The snippet above uses the `connect` function provided by `get-starknet` to establish a connection to the user wallet. Once connected, we are able to access account methods, such as `signMessage` or `execute`.

### Provider
The provider allows you to interact with the Starknet network. You can think of it as a "read" connection to the blockchain, as it doesn't allow signing transactions or messages. Just like in Ethereum, you can use a default provider, or use services such as Infura or Alchemy, both of which support Starknet, to create an RPC provider.

By default, the Provider is a sequencer provider.

```ts
export const provider = new Provider({
  sequencer: {
    network: "goerli-alpha",
  },
  // rpc: {
  //   nodeUrl: INFURA_ENDPOINT
  // }
});

const block = await provider.getBlock("latest"); // <- Get latest block    
console.log(block.block_number);
```

### Contracts
Your frontend will likely be interacting with deployed contracts. For each contract, there should be a counterpart on the frontend. To create these instances, you will need the contract's address and ABI, and either a provider or signer. 

```ts
const contract = new Contract(
  abi_erc20,
  contractAddress,
  starknet.account
);

const balance = await contract.balanceOf(starknet.account.address);
const transfer = await contract.transfer(recipientAddress, amountFormatted);
//or: const transfer = await contract.invoke("transfer", [to, amountFormatted]); 

console.log(`Tx hash: ${transfer.transaction_hash}`);
```

If you create a contract instance with a provider, you'll be limited to calling read functions on the contract - only with a signer can you change the state of the blockchain. However, you are able to connect a previously created `Contract` instance with a new account:

```ts
const contract = new Contract(
  abi_erc20,
  contractAddress,
  provider
);

contract.connect(starknet.account);
```
In the snippet above, after calling the `connect` method, it would be possible to call read functions on the contract, but not before.

## Units
If you have previous experience with web3, you know dealing with units requires care, and Starknet is no exception. Once again, the docs are very useful here, in particular https://www.starknetjs.com/docs/guides/define_call_message/[this section on data transformation].

Very often you will need to convert Cairo structs (such as Uint256) that are returned from contracts into numbers:

```ts
// Uint256 shape:
// { 
//    type: 'struct', 
//    low: Uint256.low, 
//    high: Uint256.high 
// 
// }
const balance = await contract.balanceOf(address); // <- uint256
const asBN = uint256.uint256ToBN(uint256); // <- uint256 into BN
const asString = asBN.toString() //<- BN into string
```
And vice versa:

```ts
const amount = 1;

const amountFormatted = {
    type: "struct",
    ...uint256.bnToUint256(amount),
};
```

There are other helpful utils, besides `bnToUint256` and `uint256ToBN`, provided by Starknet.js.

We now have a solid foundation to build a Starknet dapp. However, there are framework specific tools that help us build Starknet dapps, which are covered in chaper 5.
