= Starknet React: A Pathway to Robust Decentralized Applications

Authored by the https://github.com/apibara/[Apibara] team, https://github.com/apibara/starknet-react/[Starknet React] is an open-source collection of React providers and hooks meticulously designed for Starknet. Drawing inspiration from https://github.com/tmm/wagmi/[wagmi], this ingenious toolkit mimics a strikingly similar API, facilitating a smooth transition for those familiar with wagmi.

To immerse in the real-world application of Starknet React, we recommend exploring the comprehensive example dApp project at https://github.com/finiam/starknet-demo-dapp/[starknet-demo-dapp].


== Integrating Starknet React

Embarking on your Starknet React journey necessitates the incorporation of vital dependencies. Let's start by adding them to your project.

[source,shell]
----
yarn add @starknet-react/core starknet get-starknet
----

[NOTE]
====
https://www.starknetjs.com/[Starknet.js] is an essential SDK facilitating interactions with Starknet. In contrast, https://github.com/starknet-io/get-starknet/[get-starknet] is a package adept at managing wallet connections.
====

Proceed by swaddling your app within the `StarknetConfig` component. This enveloping action offers a degree of configuration, while simultaneously providing a React Context for the application beneath to utilize shared data and hooks. The `StarknetConfig` component accepts a connectors prop, allowing the definition of wallet connection options available to the user.

[source,typescript]
----
const connectors = [
  new InjectedConnector({ options: { id: "braavos" } }),
  new InjectedConnector({ options: { id: "argentX" } }),
];

return (
    <StarknetConfig
      connectors={connectors}
      autoConnect
    >
      <App />
    </StarknetConfig>
)
----

== Establishing Connection and Managing Account

Once the connectors are defined in the config, the stage is set to use a hook to access these connectors, enabling users to connect their wallets:

[source,typescript]
----
export default function Connect() {
  const { connect, connectors, disconnect } = useConnectors();

  return (
    <div>
      {connectors.map((connector) => (
        <button
          key={connector.id()}
          onClick={() => connect(connector)}
          disabled={!connector.available()}
        >
          Connect with {connector.id()}
        </button>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
----

Observe the `disconnect` function that terminates the connection when invoked. Post connection, access to the connected account is provided through the `useAccount` hook, offering insight into the current state of connection:

[source,typescript]
----
const { address, isConnected, isReconnecting, account } = useAccount();

return (
    <div>
      {isConnected ? (
          <p>Hello, {address}</p>          
      ) : (
        <Connect />
      )}
    </div>
);
----

The state values, such as `isConnected` and `isReconnecting`, receive automatic updates, simplifying UI conditional updates. This convenient pattern shines when dealing with asynchronous processes, as it eliminates the need to manually manage the state within your components.

Having established a connection, signing messages becomes a breeze using the account value returned from the `useAccount` hook. For a more streamlined experience, the `useSignTypedData` hook is at your disposal.

[source,typescript]
----
const { data, signTypedData } = useSignTypedData(typedMessage)  

return (
  <>
    <p>
      <button onClick={signTypedData}>Sign</button>
    </p>
    {data && <p>Signed: {JSON.stringify(data)}</p>}
  </>
)
----

Starknet React supports signing an array of `BigNumberish` values or an object. While signing an object, it is crucial to ensure that the data conforms to the EIP712 type. For a more comprehensive guide on signing, refer to the Starknet.js documentation: https://www.starknetjs.com/docs/guides/signature/[here].

== Displaying StarkName

After an account has been connected, the `useStarkName` hook can be used to retrieve the StarkName of this connected account. Related to https://www.starknet.id/[Starknet.id] it permits to display the user address in a more user friendly way.

[source,typescript]
----
const { data, isError, isLoading, status } = useStarkName({ address });
// You can track the status of the request with the status variable ('idle' | 'error' | 'loading' | 'success')

if (isLoading) return <p>Loading...</p>
return <p>Account: {isError ? address : data}</p>
----
You also have additional information you can get from this hook -> **error**, **isIdle**, **isFetching**, **isSuccess**, **isFetched**, **isFetchedAfterMount**, **isRefetching**, **refetch** which can give you more precise information on what is happening.


== Fetching address from StarkName

You could also want to retrieve an address corresponding to a StarkName. For this purpose, you can use the `useAddressFromStarkName` hook.

[source,typescript]
----
const { data, isLoading, isError } = useAddressFromStarkName({ name: 'vitalik.stark' })

if (isLoading) return <p>Loading...</p>
if (isError) return <p>Something went wrong</p>
return <p>Address: {data}</p>
----

If the provided name does not have an associated address, it will return **"0x0"**

== Navigating the Network

In addition to wallet and account management, Starknet React equips developers with hooks for network interactions. For instance, useBlock enables the retrieval of the latest block:

[source,typescript]
----
const { data, isError, isFetching } = useBlock({
    refetchInterval: 10_000,
    blockIdentifier: "latest",
});

if (isError) {
  return (
    <p>Something went wrong</p>
  )
}

return (
    <p>Current block: {isFetching ? "Loading..." : data?.block_number}<p>
)
----

In the aforementioned code, refetchInterval controls the frequency of data refetching. Behind the scenes, Starknet React harnesses https://github.com/TanStack/query/[react-query] for managing state and queries. In addition to useBlock, Starknet React offers other hooks like useContractRead and useWaitForTransaction, which can be configured to update at regular intervals.

The useStarknet hook provides direct access to the ProviderInterface:

[source,typescript]
----
const { library } = useStarknet();

// library.getClassByHash(...)
// library.getTransaction(...)
----

== Tracking Wallet changes

To improve your dApp User Experience, you can track the user wallet changes, especially when the user changes the wallet account (or connects/disconnects). But also when the user changes the network.
You could want to reload correct balances when the user changes the account, or to reset the state of your dApp when the user changes the network.
To do so, you can use a previous hook we already looked at: `useAccount` and a new one `useNetwork`.

The `useNetwork` hook will give you the current Chain currently used.

[source,typescript]
----
const { chain: {id, name} } = useNetwork();

return (
    <>
        <p>Connected chain: {name}</p>
        <p>Connected chain id: {id}</p>
    </>
)
----

You also have additional information you can get from this hook -> **blockExplorer**, **testnet** which can give you more precise information about the current using network.

After knowing this you have all you need to track user interaction on the using account and network. You can use the `useEffect` hook to do some work on changes.

[source,typescript]
----
const { chain } = useNetwork();
const { address } = useAccount();

useEffect(() => {
    if(address) {
        // Do some work when the user changes the account on the wallet
        // Like reloading the balances
    }else{
        // Do some work when the user disconnects the wallet
        // Like reseting the state of your dApp
    }
}, [address]);

useEffect(() => {
    // Do some work when the user changes the network on the wallet
    // Like reseting the state of your dApp
}, [chain]);

----

== Contract Interactions

=== Read Functions

Starknet React presents useContractRead, a specialized hook for invoking read functions on contracts, akin to wagmi. This hook functions independently of the user's connection status, as read operations do not necessitate a signer.

[source,typescript]
----
const { data: balance, isLoading, isError, isSuccess } = useContractRead({
    abi: abi_erc20,
    address: CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
    functionName: "allowance",
    args: [owner, spender],
    // watch: true <- refresh at every block
});
----


For ERC20 operations, Starknet React offers a convenient useBalance hook. This hook exempts you from passing an ABI and returns a suitably formatted balance value.

[source,typescript]
----
  const { data, isLoading } = useBalance({
    address,
    token: CONTRACT_ADDRESS, // <- defaults to the ETH token
    // watch: true <- refresh at every block
  });

  return (
    <p>Balance: {data?.formatted} {data?.symbol}</p>
  )
----

=== Write Functions

The useContractWrite hook, designed for write operations, deviates slightly from wagmi. The unique architecture of Starknet facilitates multicall transactions natively at the account level. This feature enhances the user experience when executing multiple transactions, eliminating the need to approve each transaction individually. Starknet React capitalizes on this functionality through the useContractWrite hook. Below is a demonstration of its usage:

[source,typescript]
----
const calls = useMemo(() => {
    // compile the calldata to send
    const calldata = stark.compileCalldata({
      argName: argValue,
    });

    // return a single object for single transaction, 
    // or an array of objects for multicall**
    return {
      contractAddress: CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
      entrypoint: functionName,
      calldata,
    };        
}, [argValue]);


// Returns a function to trigger the transaction
// and state of tx after being sent
const { write, isLoading, data } = useContractWrite({
    calls,
});

function execute() {
  // trigger the transaction
  write();
}

return (
  <button type="button" onClick={execute}>
    Make a transaction
  </button>
)
----

The code snippet begins by compiling the calldata using the compileCalldata utility provided by Starknet.js. This calldata, along with the contract address and entry point, are passed to the useContractWrite hook. The hook returns a write function that is subsequently used to execute the transaction. The hook also provides the transaction's hash and state.

=== A Single Contract Instance

In certain use cases, working with a single contract instance may be preferable to specifying the contract address and ABI in each hook. Starknet React accommodates this requirement with the useContract hook:

[source,typescript]
----
const { contract } = useContract({
    address: CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
    abi: abi_erc20,
});

// Call functions directly on contract
// contract.transfer(...);
// contract.balanceOf(...);
----

== Tracking Transactions

The useTransaction hook allows for the tracking of transaction states given a transaction hash. This hook maintains a cache of all transactions, thereby minimizing redundant network requests.

[source,typescript]
----
const { data, isLoading, error } = useTransaction({ hash: txHash });

return (
  <pre>
    {JSON.stringify(data?.calldata)}
  </pre>
)
----

The full array of available hooks can be discovered in the Starknet React documentation, accessible here: https://apibara.github.io/starknet-react/.
