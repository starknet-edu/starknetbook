= Scarb and the Structure of a Cairo Project

Scarb is the Cairo package manager specifically created to streamline your Cairo and Starknet development process. Scarb is capable of managing project dependencies, compiling projects (both pure Cairo and Starknet contracts), downloading the necessary libraries, building these libraries, and integrating seamlessly with other essential development tools such as Protostar. 

== Integrating Scarb into Your Development Workflow

The steps below illustrate a typical workflow in developing a Starknet contract using Scarb:

1. **Initializing the Project:** Start by running `scarb new` to create a new project. This command will automatically generate the project's basic structure, including a `Scarb.toml` configuration file and an initial `src/lib.cairo` file.

2. **Developing the Contract:** Write your Cairo code and store it in the `src` directory.

3. **Managing Dependencies:** If your contract depends on external libraries, use `scarb add` to effortlessly include these dependencies in your project.

4. **Compiling the Contract:** Run `scarb build` to compile your contract into Sierra code. This resulting code can then be examined further, or used as input for other tools or processes.

By integrating Scarb into your workflow, you leverage its features to make your development process more efficient and manageable.

== Installation

Scarb is compatible with macOS, Linux, and Windows operating systems. 

Follow the instructions in the https://book.starknet.io/chapter_1/environment_setup.html#the_scarb_package_manager_installation[setup guide of Chapter 1].

== Structure of a Cairo Project

A Cairo project includes several crucial components that help create and manage a smart contract. Let's explore each part in detail.

=== Cairo Packages

Cairo packages, also referred to as "crates" in some contexts, are the building blocks of a Cairo project. Each package must follow several rules:

* A package must include a `Scarb.toml` file, which is Scarb's manifest file. It contains the dependencies for your package.
* A package must include a `src/lib.cairo` file, which is the root of the package tree. It allows you to define functions and declare used modules.

Package structures might look like the following case where we have a package named `my_package`, which includes a `src` directory with the `lib.cairo` file inside, a `snips` directory which in itself a package we can use, and a `Scarb.toml` file in the top-level directory.

[source,bash]
----
my_package/
├── src/
│   ├── module1.cairo
│   ├── module2.cairo
│   └── lib.cairo
├── snips/
│   ├── src/
│   │   ├── lib.cairo
│   ├── Scarb.toml
└── Scarb.toml
----

Within the `Scarb.toml` file, you might have:

[source,toml]
----
[package]
name = "my_package"
version = "0.1.0"

[dependencies]
starknet = ">=2.0.1"
snips = { path = "snips" }
----

Here starknet and snips are the dependencies of the package. The `starknet` dependency is hosted on the Scarb registry (we do not need to download it), while the `snips` dependency is located in the `snips` directory.

== Setting Up a Project with Scarb

To create a new project using Scarb, navigate to your desired project directory and execute the following command:

[source, bash]
----
$ scarb new hello_scarb
----

This command will create a new project directory named `hello_scarb`, including a `Scarb.toml` file, a `src` directory with a `lib.cairo` file inside, and initialize a new Git repository with a `.gitignore` file.

[source, bash]
----
hello_scarb/
├── src/
│   └── lib.cairo  
└── Scarb.toml
----

Upon opening `Scarb.toml` in a text editor, you should see something similar to the code snippet below:

[source, bash]
----
[package]
name = "hello_scarb"
version = "0.1.0"

# See more keys and their definitions at https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb/docs/reference/manifest
[dependencies]
# foo = { path = "vendor/foo" }
----

== Building a Scarb Project

Clear all content in `src/lib.cairo` and replace with the following:

[source, rust]
----
// src/lib.cairo
mod hello_scarb;
----

Next, create a new file titled `src/hello_scarb.cairo` and add the following:

[source, rust]
----
// src/hello_scarb.cairo
use debug::PrintTrait;
fn main() {
    'Hello, Scarb!'.print();
}
----

In this instance, the `lib.cairo` file contains a module declaration referencing 'hello_scarb', which includes the 'hello_scarb.cairo' file's implementation. For more on modules, imports, and the `lib.cairo` file, please refer to the subchapter on https://book.starknet.io/chapter_2/imports.html[imports in Chapter 2].

Scarb mandates that your source files be located within the `src` directory.

To build (compile) your project from your `hello_scarb` directory, use the following command:

[source, bash]
----
scarb build
----

This command compiles your project and produces the Sierra code in the `target/dev/hello_scarb.sierra` file. Sierra serves as an intermediate layer between high-level Cairo and compilation targets such as Cairo Assembly (CASM). To understand more about Sierra, check out this https://medium.com/nethermind-eth/under-the-hood-of-cairo-1-0-exploring-sierra-7f32808421f5/[article].

To remove the build artifacts and delete the target directory, use the `scarb clean` command.

=== Adding Dependencies

Scarb facilitates the seamless management of dependencies for your Cairo packages. Here are two methods to add dependencies to your project:

* Edit Scarb.toml File

Open the Scarb.toml file in your project directory and locate the `[dependencies]` section. If it doesn't exist, add it. To include a dependency hosted on a Git repository, use the following format:

[source, toml]
----
[dependencies]
alexandria_math = { git = "https://github.com/keep-starknet-strange/alexandria.git" }
----

For consistency, it's recommended to pin Git dependencies to specific commits. This can be done by adding the `rev` field with the commit hash:

[source, toml]
----
[dependencies]
alexandria_math = { git = "https://github.com/keep-starknet-strange/alexandria.git", rev = "81bb93c" }
----

After adding the dependency, remember to save the file.

* Use the scarb add Command

Alternatively, you can use the `scarb add` command to add dependencies to your project. Open your terminal and execute the following command:

[source, bash]
----
$ scarb add alexandria_math --git https://github.com/keep-starknet-strange/alexandria.git
----

This command will add the alexandria_math dependency from the specified Git repository to your project.

To remove a dependency, you can use the `scarb rm` command.

Once a dependency is added, the Scarb.toml file will be automatically updated with the new dependency information.

=== Using Dependencies in Your Code

After dependencies are added to your project, you can start utilizing them in your Cairo code.

For example, let’s assume you have added the alexandria_math dependency. Now, you can import and utilize functions from the alexandria_math library in your `src/hello_scarb.cairo` file:

[source, rust]
----
// src/hello_scarb.cairo
use alexandria_math::fibonacci;

fn main() -> felt252 {
    fibonacci::fib(0, 1, 10)
}
----

In the above example, we import the fibonacci function from the alexandria_math library and utilize it in the main function.

== Scarb Cheat Sheet

Here's a quick cheat sheet of some of the most commonly used Scarb commands:

* `scarb new <project_name>`: Initialize a new project with the given project name.
* `scarb build`: Compile your Cairo code into Sierra code.
* `scarb add <dependency> --git <repository>`: Add a dependency to your project from a specified Git repository.
* `scarb rm <dependency>`: Remove a dependency from your project.
* `scarb run <script>`: Run a custom script defined in your `Scarb.toml` file.

Scarb is a versatile tool, and this is just the beginning of what you can achieve with it. As you gain more experience in the Cairo language and the Starknet platform, you'll discover how much more you can do with Scarb.
