/// @title Vote Contract
/// @author starknet community
/// @notice This contract allows three registered voters to submit their votes (1 for Yes/0 for No) on a proposal.
/// @dev It keeps track of the number of yes votes and no votes, and provides view (getter) functions 
/// to check the voting status and voter eligibility.
/// The contract is initialized with three registered voters. 
/// The contract is deployed on the Starknet testnet. The contract address is 0x0780b126f03c2e28a3ecd27e6c1c367d3df796050f0831e36c899a8c2f1dbdbb
