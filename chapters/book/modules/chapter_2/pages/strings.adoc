= Strings in Cairo

Cairo currently (this will change in the near future) has limited support for strings, which makes it challenging to work with long strings. However, you can use short strings in your Cairo contracts, as we did in the https://github.com/starknet-edu/starknetbook/blob/main/chapters/modules/chapter_2/pages/contracts/src/pokemon_array.cairo[Pokémon example]. These short strings are ultimately converted into `felt252`.

== Working with Short Strings

As we mentioned, Cairo can handle only short strings, like 'Wrong pokemon' in our Pokémon contract. Keep in mind that, unlike other programming languages, Cairo doesn't have built-in support for string manipulation or complex string operations.

[source, rust]
----
fn index_pokemon_array() {
    let mut pokemons: Array<felt252> = create_pokemon_array();

    assert(*pokemons.get(0_usize).unwrap().unbox() == 'Pikachu', "Wrong pokemon");
    assert(*pokemons.at(1_usize) == 'Charmander', "Wrong pokemon");
}
----

In this example:

* The short strings 'Pikachu', 'Charmander', and 'Wrong pokemon' are used in the code.

This is how the short strings are converted into `felt252`:
* 'Pikachu' is converted into: 22633908053174389.
* 'Charmander' is converted into: 318324037530966278038898.
* 'Wrong pokemon' is converted into: 6928266141989273178278057570158.

Currently, when coding with Cairo we need to constantly be converting between felt252s and strings. You can use the https://www.stark-utils.xyz/converter[Stark Utils] converter for this.

This is a tedious process, which the Cairo community is improving in the near future.

== Summary

In this chapter, we explored strings in Cairo and learned about their limitations. As a quick recap:

* *Short strings*: Cairo can handle only short strings, which can be used directly in your contracts.
* *Conversion to felt252*: When working with short strings in Cairo, they are converted into `felt252`.
* *Limited string manipulation*: Cairo doesn't offer built-in support for complex string manipulation or operations.
* *Convert between felt252 and short strings*: You can use the https://www.stark-utils.xyz/converter[Stark Utils] converter to convert between felt252s and strings.

Despite its limitations, Cairo provides basic string handling capabilities, which can be sufficient for simple use cases in your contracts.
