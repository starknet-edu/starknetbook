= Cairo and the Ethereum Virtual Machine: The Kakarot ZKEVM

== What is Kakarot?

Kakarot is a groundbreaking zkEVM (Zero-Knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine) built on the CairoVM. 
Overall, it aims to present to developers an abstraction layer they're familiar with: the EVM.

=== Introduction

Kakarot is meant for developers to build and deploy as if they were working on Ethereum: its purpose is to allow Solidity contracts to be forward compatible with Starknet and the CairoVM.

The project plans to bring **EVM compatibility** to Starknet and build a *zkRollup-as-a-service tool*. 
It began in October 2022 and aims to create an open-source, provable zkEVM in Cairo, with a concise codebase. It is designed with the belief that the CairoVM will provide the best zero-knowledge toolbox in the coming years and that the Ethereum network effect will remain dominant in the meantime. 

In a remarkable display of skill and dedication, the Kakarot team achieved an impressive milestone 
(with the support of the Starknet Foundation and the collaborative efforts of over 40 unique contributors) 
by implementing 100% of EVM opcodes and 8 out of 9 EVM precompiles in just six months and with less than 5,000 lines of code!

Kakarot is on track to become a type 2.5 zkEVM (as per https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/08/04/zkevm.html[Vitalik Buterin's typology]), offering compatibility with existing EVM code. 
Its innovative solution combines the benefits of zero-knowledge cryptography and the efficiency of the EVM, paving the way for scalable and secure decentralized applications.
In simple words, Kakarot allows developers to easily and seamlessly run Ethereum smart-contracts written in Solidity on Starknet, **without requiring any modifications to their code**!

==== Note that Kakarot is currently a work in progress - not yet ready for production.

The testnet version is expected to be released at the end of summer 2023â€¦ Stay tuned!

=== Project Architecture

image::Kakarot-architecture.png[]

*  Kakarot is a smart contract, currently deployed on Starknet (goerli testnet). It is written in Cairo.
* Kakarot is an EVM bytecode interpreter. 
* Kakarot can: 
.. execute arbitrary EVM bytecode, 
.. deploy an EVM smart contract as is, 
.. call a Kakarot-deployed EVM smart contract's functions (views and write methods).
* Kakarot is not a blockchain.
* Kakarot is not a compiler: it will not convert your Solidity code into Cairo code (check out https://book.starknet.io/chapter_2/warp.html[Warp] for a Solidity -> Cairo transpiler). 

== Exploring some Use cases of Kakarot

=== Allowing already-existing Ethereum smart-contracts to be ran on Starknet

Despite Starknet running on the CairoVM instead of the EVM, thanks to Kakarot zkRollup-as-a-service tool, any Solidity smart-contract deployed on Ethereum will be able to be ran on Starknet without any change of its code.
This means that the decentralized applications that are already running on Ethereum will be able to be ran on Starknet very easily, allowing their users to take advantage of both the efficiency of the EVM and the benefits of zero-knowledge cryptography.

Thus, Kakarot will massively reduce the time to migrate any existing Solidity smart-contract to Starknet: instead of re-writing your whole protocol from Solidity to Cairo, you will just have to use Kakarot to run your Solidity contract in the CairoVM. It's that simple! 
 
=== Allowing Solidity blockchain developers to deploy provable contracts on Starknet without learning Cairo

Perhaps one does not necessarily wishes to learn a whole new language just for a tiny side project, for example. In that case, even though Cairo is, for many different reasons, https://cairo-book.github.io/ch00-00-introduction.html[a wonderful language] thanks to Kakarot, developers will not be totally obligated to learn Cairo in order to create and deploy smart-contracts on Starknet:
they will have the possibility to make their Solidity smart-contracts become provable and will also be able to be ran them on Starknet with no effort!
