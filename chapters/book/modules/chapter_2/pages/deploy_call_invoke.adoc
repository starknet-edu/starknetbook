= Deploying, Calling and Invoking Contracts

In this chapter, we'll explore how to interact with deployed Starknet contracts using _calling_ and _invoking_. We'll use the voting contract as an example.

* Calling contracts: Interacting with contract functions marked with the `#[view]` entry point. These functions do not alter the state of the network, so they don't require fees or signing. This is similar to a `call` in the Ethereum API.
* Invoking contracts: Interacting with contract functions marked with the `#[external]` entry point. These functions do alter the state of the network and require fees and signing. This is similar to a `deploy` in the Ethereum API.

In this subchapter, we will setup a local development node using `katana` to deploy the voting contract. Then, we'll interact with the contract by calling and invoking its functions. You can also use the Goerli Testnet instead of `katana`. However, we recommend using `katana` for local development and testing. You can find the complete tutorial for `katana` on the https://book.starknet.io/chapter_3/katana.html[Chapter 3] of the StarkNet Book.

== Preparing your Environment with the `katana` local Starknet node

`katana` is designed to support local development by the https://github.com/dojoengine/dojo/blob/main/crates/katana/README.md[Dojo team]. It will allow do everything you need to do with Starknet, but locally. It is a great tool for development and testing.

To install `katana` from the source code, please refer to the https://book.starknet.io/chapter_3/katana.html[katana subchapter in Chapter 3] of the Book.

Once you have `katana` installed, you can start the local Starknet node with:

[source,bash]
----
katana --accounts 3 --seed 0 --gas-price 250
----

This command will start a local Starknet node with 3 deployed accounts. We will use these accounts to deploy and interact with the voting contract:

[source,bash]
----

Before we can interact with the voting contract, we need to prepare the voter and admin accounts on Starknet. Each voter account must be registered and sufficiently funded for voting. For a more detailed understanding of how accounts operate with Account Abstraction, refer to the https://book.starknet.io/chapter_5/index.html[Account Abstraction] chapter.

Ensure your https://book.starknet.io/chapter_1/environment_setup.html[environment] is ready as detailed in Chapter 1. Then, you can create a new Scarb project for the voting contract:

[source,bash]
----
scarb new Vote
----

You can write in the `src/lib.cairo` file of the project. The voting contract is already written in the https://github.com/starknet-edu/starknetbook/blob/main/chapters/book/modules/chapter_2/pages/contracts/src/vote.cairo[GitHub repository] or copy the code from the https://book.starknet.io/chapter_2/fundamentals.html[Fundamentals subchapter].

== Preparing Smart Wallets for Voting

As mentioned in the https://book.starknet.io/chapter_1/first_contract.html[first Starknet smart contract of Chapter 1], for each smart wallet we'll use, we must create a Signer within the encrypted keystore and an Account Descriptor.

We can create Signers and Account Descriptors for the accounts we want to use for voting. Let's create a smart wallet for voting in our smart contract.

Firstly, we create a signer from a private key:

[source,bash]
----
starkli signer keystore from-key ~/.starkli-wallets/deployer/account0_keystore.json
----

Then, we create the Account Descriptor:

[source,bash]
----
touch ~/.starkli-wallets/deployer/account0_account.json
----

The Account Descriptor will look like this. You can get the public key and the smart wallet address from the output of the initial `katana` command:

[source,bash]
----
{
  "version": 1,
  "variant": {
        "type": "open_zeppelin",
        "version": 1,
        "public_key": "<SMART_WALLET_PUBLIC_KEY>"
  },
    "deployment": {
        "status": "deployed",
        "class_hash": "<SMART_WALLET_CLASS_HASH>",
        "address": "<SMART_WALLET_ADDRESS>"
  }
}
----

You can retrieve the smart wallet class hash (it will be the same for all you smart wallets) with the following command. Notice the use of the `--rpc` flagand the RPC endpoint provided by `katana`:

[source,bash]
----
starkli class-hash-at <SMART_WALLET_ADDRESS> --rpc http://0.0.0.0:5050
----

For the pubic key, you can use the `starkli signer keystore inspect` command directored to the keystore json file:

[source,bash]
----
starkli signer keystore inspect ~/.starkli-wallets/deployer/account0_keystore.json
----

This process is identical for account_1 and account_2 in case you want to have a second and a third voter.

== Contract Deployment

Before deploying, we need to declare the contract. We can do this with the `starkli declare` command:

[source,bash]
----
starkli declare target/dev/starknetbook_chapter_2_Vote.sierra.json --compiler-version 2.0.1 --rpc http://0.0.0.0:5050 --account ~/.starkli-wallets/deployer/account0_account.json --keystore ~/.starkli-wallets/deployer/account0_keystore.json
----

The class hash of the contract is: 0x06974677a079b7edfadcd70aa4d12aac0263a4cda379009fca125e0ab1a9ba52. You can find it https://goerli.voyager.online/class/0x06974677a079b7edfadcd70aa4d12aac0263a4cda379009fca125e0ab1a9ba52[on any block explorer].

The `--rpc` flag specifies the RPC endpoint to use (the one provided by `katana`). The `--account` flag specifies the account to use for signing the transaction. The account we use here is the one we created in the previous step. The `--keystore` flag specifies the keystore file to use for signing the transaction.

Since we are using a local node, the transaction will achieve finality immediately. If you are using the Goerli Testnet, you will need to wait for the transaction to be final, which usually takes a few seconds.

The following command deploys the voting contract and registers voter_0, voter_1, and voter_2 as eligible voters. These are the constructor arguments, so add a voter account that you can later vote with.

[source,bash]
----
starknet deploy <class_hash_of_the_contract_to_be_deployed> <voter_0_address> <voter_1_address> <voter_2_address> --rpc http://0.0.0.0:5050 --account ~/.starkli-wallets/deployer/account0_account.json --keystore ~/.starkli-wallets/deployer/account0_keystore.json
----

An example command:

[source,bash]
----
starkli deploy 0x06974677a079b7edfadcd70aa4d12aac0263a4cda379009fca125e0ab1a9ba52 0x03ee9e18edc71a6df30ac3aca2e0b02a198fbce19b7480a63a0d71cbd76652e0 0x033c627a3e5213790e246a917770ce23d7e562baa5b4d2917c23b1be6d91961c 0x01d98d835e43b032254ffbef0f150c5606fa9c5c9310b1fae370ab956a7919f5 --rpc http://0.0.0.0:5050 --account ~/.starkli-wallets/deployer/account0_account.json --keystore ~/.starkli-wallets/deployer/account0_keystore.json
----

In this case, the contract has been deployed at an specific address: `0x05ea3a690be71c7fcd83945517f82e8861a97d42fca8ec9a2c46831d11f33349`. This address will be different for you. We will use this address to interact with the contract.

== Voter Eligibility Verification

In our voting contract, we have two functions to validate voter eligibility, `voter_can_vote` and `is_voter_registered`. These are read external functions, which mean they don't alter the state of the contract but only read the current state.

The `is_voter_registered` function checks whether a particular address is registered as an eligible voter in the contract. The `voter_can_vote` function, on the other hand, checks whether the voter at a specific address is currently eligible to vote, i.e., they are registered and haven't voted already.

You can call these functions using the `starkli call` command. Note that the `call` command is used for read functions, while the `invoke` command is used for functions that can also write to storage. The `call` command does not require signing, while the `invoke` command does.

[source,bash]
----
starkli call 0x05ea3a690be71c7fcd83945517f82e8861a97d42fca8ec9a2c46831d11f33349 voter_can_vote 0x03ee9e18edc71a6df30ac3aca2e0b02a198fbce19b7480a63a0d71cbd76652e0 --rpc http://0.0.0.0:5050
----

First we added the address of the contract, then the function we want to call, and finally the input for the function. In this case, we are checking whether the voter at the address `0x03ee9e18edc71a6df30ac3aca2e0b02a198fbce19b7480a63a0d71cbd76652e0` can vote.

Since we provided a registered voter address as an input, the result is 1 (boolean true), indicating the voter is eligible to vote.

Next, let's call the `is_voter_registered` function using an unregistered account address to observe the output:

[source, bash]
----
starkli call 0x05ea3a690be71c7fcd83945517f82e8861a97d42fca8ec9a2c46831d11f33349 is_voter_registered 0x44444444444444444 --rpc http://0.0.0.0:5050
----

With an unregistered account address, the terminal output is 0 (i.e., false), confirming that the account is not eligible to vote.

== Casting a Vote

Now that we have established how to verify voter eligibility, we can vote! To vote, we interact with the `vote` function, which is flagged as external, necessitating the use of the `starknet invoke` command.

The `invoke` command syntax resembles the `call` command, but for voting, we submit either 1 (for Yes) or 0 (for No) as our input. When we invoke the `vote` function, we are charged a fee, and the transaction must be signed by the voter; we are writing to the contract's storage.

[source,bash]
----
//Voting Yes
starkli invoke 0x05ea3a690be71c7fcd83945517f82e8861a97d42fca8ec9a2c46831d11f33349 vote 1 --rpc http://0.0.0.0:5050 --account ~/.starkli-wallets/deployer/account0_account.json --keystore ~/.starkli-wallets/deployer/account0_keystore.json

//Voting No
starkli invoke 0x05ea3a690be71c7fcd83945517f82e8861a97d42fca8ec9a2c46831d11f33349 vote 0 --rpc http://0.0.0.0:5050 --account ~/.starkli-wallets/deployer/account0_account.json --keystore ~/.starkli-wallets/deployer/account0_keystore.json
----

You will be prompted to enter the password for the signer. Once you enter the password, the transaction will be signed and submitted to the Starknet network. You will receive the transaction hash as output. With the starkli transaction command, you can get more details about the transaction:

[source,bash]
----
starkli transaction <TRANSACTION_HASH> --rpc http://0.0.0.0:5050
----

This returns:

[source,bash]
----
{
  "transaction_hash": "0x5604a97922b6811060e70ed0b40959ea9e20c726220b526ec690de8923907fd",
  "max_fee": "0x430e81",
  "version": "0x1",
  "signature": [
    "0x75e5e4880d7a8301b35ff4a1ed1e3d72fffefa64bb6c306c314496e6e402d57",
    "0xbb6c459b395a535dcd00d8ab13d7ed71273da4a8e9c1f4afe9b9f4254a6f51"
  ],
  "nonce": "0x3",
  "type": "INVOKE",
  "sender_address": "0x3ee9e18edc71a6df30ac3aca2e0b02a198fbce19b7480a63a0d71cbd76652e0",
  "calldata": [
    "0x1",
    "0x5ea3a690be71c7fcd83945517f82e8861a97d42fca8ec9a2c46831d11f33349",
    "0x132bdf85fc8aa10ac3c22f02317f8f53d4b4f52235ed1eabb3a4cbbe08b5c41",
    "0x0",
    "0x1",
    "0x1",
    "0x1"
  ]
}
----

If you try to vote twice with the same signer you will get an error:

[source,bash]
----
Error: code=ContractError, message="Contract error"
----

The error is not very informative, but you can get more details when looking at the output in the terminal where you started `katana` (our local Starknet node):

[source,bash]
----
...
Transaction execution error: "Error in the called contract (0x03ee9e18edc71a6df30ac3aca2e0b02a198fbce19b7480a63a0d71cbd76652e0):
    Error at pc=0:81:
    Got an exception while executing a hint: Custom Hint Error: Execution failed. Failure reason: \"USER_ALREADY_VOTED\".
    ...
----

The key for the error is `USER_ALREADY_VOTED`. We defined this error in the https://book.starknet.io/chapter_2/fundamentals.html[vote contract]:

[source,rust]
----
assert(can_vote == true, 'USER_ALREADY_VOTED');
----

We can repeat the process to create Signers and Account Descriptors for the accounts we want to use for voting. Remember that each Signer must be created from a private key, and each Account Descriptor must be created from a public key, a smart wallet address, and the smart wallet class hash (which is the same for each voter).

[source,bash]
----
starkli invoke 0x05ea3a690be71c7fcd83945517f82e8861a97d42fca8ec9a2c46831d11f33349 vote 0 --rpc http://0.0.0.0:5050 --account ~/.starkli-wallets/deployer/account1_account.json --keystore ~/.starkli-wallets/deployer/account1_keystore.json

starkli invoke 0x05ea3a690be71c7fcd83945517f82e8861a97d42fca8ec9a2c46831d11f33349 vote 1 --rpc http://0.0.0.0:5050 --account ~/.starkli-wallets/deployer/account2_account.json --keystore ~/.starkli-wallets/deployer/account2_keystore.json
----

== Visualizing Vote Outcomes

To examine the voting results, we invoke the `get_vote_results` function, another view function, through the `starknet call` command.

[source,bash]
----
starkli call 0x05ea3a690be71c7fcd83945517f82e8861a97d42fca8ec9a2c46831d11f33349 get_vote_status --rpc http://0.0.0.0:5050
----

The output reveals the tally of "Yes" and "No" votes along with their relative percentages.

Bravo! You have now successfully deployed and interacted with a StarkNet voting smart contract!
