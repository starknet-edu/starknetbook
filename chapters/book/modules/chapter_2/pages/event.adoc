= Events in Starknet Contracts

In this chapter, we will focus on events in a Starknet contract, using an extended version of the voting contract as an example. Events are a useful tool for logging and notifying external entities about specific occurrences within a contract. They emit data that can be accessed by clients.

== Voting Contract with Events

In this example, we will use the following extended version of the voting contract. The additions to the contract include traits, implementations, and events. The contract allows three registered voters to submit their votes (1 for Yes/0 for No) on a proposal. It keeps track of the number of yes votes and no votes and provides view (getter) functions to check the voting status and voter eligibility.

== Defining Events

To define an event in a Starknet contract, you can use the `#[event]` attribute followed by the event definition. In our extended voting contract, we have one event called `VoteCast`, which is emitted when a vote is cast. The event takes two parameters: the voter's address and the vote value (0 for No, 1 for Yes).

[source,rust]
----
#[event]
fn VoteCast(voter: ContractAddress, vote: u8) {}
----

== Emitting Events

To emit an event, simply call the event function with the appropriate arguments. In our voting contract, the `VoteCast` event is emitted after the vote has been processed in the `vote` function.

[source,rust]
----
// Emit the VoteCast event after the vote has been processed
VoteCast(caller, vote);
----

Events in Starknet contracts are not directly readable from within the contract itself. Instead, events are designed to be consumed by external off-chain entities, such as clients or other services that are listening to the contract.

To get the value from an event, you need to set up an off-chain service or client to listen for the event emitted by the contract. This can be achieved using SDKs. For example, the Starknet SDK for Python provides a `listen_for_event` function that can be used to listen for events emitted by a contract. In following sections, we will see how to use Starknet SDKs to listen for events emitted by our voting contract.
