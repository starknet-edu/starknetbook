= Events in Starknet Contracts

Events are a useful tool for logging and notifying external entities about specific occurrences within a contract. They emit data that can be accessed by clients.

== Defining Events

To define an event in a Starknet contract, you can use the **`#[event]`** attribute followed by the event definition. In our voting contract, we have two events, **`VoteCast`** and **`UnauthorizedAttempt`**.

The **`VoteCast`** event is emitted when a vote is cast. The event takes two parameters: the voter's address and the vote value (0 for No, 1 for Yes).

[source,rust]
----
[derive(Drop, starknet::Event)]
struct VoteCast {
    voter: ContractAddress,
    vote: u8,
}
----

The **`UnauthorizedAttempt`** event is emitted when an unauthorized attempt to vote is detected. The event takes one parameter: the address of the unauthorized caller.

[source,rust]
----
#[derive(Drop, starknet::Event)]
struct UnauthorizedAttempt {
    unauthorized_address: ContractAddress,
}
----

== Emitting Events

To emit an event, simply call the **`emit`** method with the appropriate event structure as an argument.

In our voting contract, the **`VoteCast`** event is emitted after the vote has been processed in the **`vote`** function.

[source,rust]
----
// Emit the VoteCast event after the vote has been processed
self.emit(VoteCast { voter: caller, vote: vote, });
----

Similarly, the **`UnauthorizedAttempt`** event is emitted if an unauthorized attempt to vote is detected.

[source,rust]
----
// Emit the UnauthorizedAttempt event after detecting an unauthorized attempt to vote
self.emit(UnauthorizedAttempt { unauthorized_address: address, });
----

Events in Starknet contracts are not directly readable from within the contract itself. Instead, events are designed to be consumed by external off-chain entities, such as clients or other services that are listening to the contract.

To get the value from an event, you need to set up an off-chain service or client to listen for the event emitted by the contract. This can be achieved using SDKs. For example, the Starknet SDK for Python provides a **`listen_for_event`** function that can be used to listen for events emitted by a contract. In following sections, we will see how to use Starknet SDKs to listen for events emitted by our voting contract."
