== Where to Start?

Depending on your goals and interests, you can choose different paths through the Starknet Book. Here are some recommendations based on various objectives:

* If you're a *complete beginner* and want to start learning about Cairo and Starknet from scratch, follow the book in its entirety, starting with *Introduction to Starknet*.

* If you're an *experienced developer* looking to quickly dive into writing scalable and decentralized smart contracts, focus on *Smart Contracts in Cairo and Starknet Tooling*.

* If you're a *frontend developer* wanting to integrate Starknet with a React frontend using Javascript, prioritize the *starknet-js* and *starknet-react* subchapters in *Starknet Tooling*

* If you're a *DevOps engineer* or *node operator* interested in running a Starknet node and indexer, head straight to *Starknet Architecture*.

* If you're a *security researcher* or *smart contract auditor* wanting to learn about the Account Abstraction feature and its implications, go for *Account Abstraction*.

* If you're a *blockchain enthusiast* curious about the underlying architecture and mechanics of Starknet and Cairo, explore *Starknet and Cairo CPU Architecture*.

* If you're a *cryptography expert* or *researcher* eager to understand the fundamentals of STARKs and their connection to the Starknet ecosystem, delve into *STARKs*.

Feel free to mix and match these paths based on your unique interests and requirements.
