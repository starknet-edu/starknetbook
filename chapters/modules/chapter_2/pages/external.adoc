= External Functions in Cairo

External functions are functions that can be called by other contracts or externally by users through a transaction on the blockchain. They can change the contract's state, and therefore, require gas fees for execution. This means that we can write to the contract's storage using the `write` function.

In Cairo, external functions are defined using the `#[external]` attribute. In Solidity, you would use the `public` or `external` keyword to define a similar type of function. 

In the Vote contract, there is only one external function: `vote`. Let's examine it in detail:

[source,rust]
----
// @dev Submit a vote (0 for No and 1 for Yes)
// @param vote (u8): vote value, 0 for No and 1 for Yes
// @return () : updates the storage with the vote count and marks the voter as not allowed to vote again
#[external]
fn vote(vote: u8) {
    // Check if the vote is valid (0 or 1)
    assert(vote == 0_u8 | vote == 1_u8, 'VOTE_0_OR_1');

    // Know if a voter has already voted and continue if they have not voted
    let caller : ContractAddress = get_caller_address();
    assert_allowed(caller);

    // Mark that the voter has already voted and update in the storage
    can_vote::write(caller, false);

    // Update the vote count in the storage depending on the vote value (0 or 1)
    if (vote == 0_u8) {
        no_votes::write(no_votes::read() + 1_u8);
    }
    if (vote == 1_u8) {
        yes_votes::write(yes_votes::read() + 1_u8);
    }
}
----

The `vote` function is an external function that allows users to submit their vote (0 for No and 1 for Yes) to the contract. It takes a `u8` value as input, checks if the value is valid (0 or 1), and updates the storage accordingly.
