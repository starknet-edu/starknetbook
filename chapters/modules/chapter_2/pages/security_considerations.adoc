= Security Considerations in Cairo

When working with any blockchain programming language, it's crucial to be aware of potential vulnerabilities in smart contracts in order to protect your projects from threats that could compromise the trust users place in your systems. Cairo is no exception.

This chapter will explain some common security issues and vulnerabilities specific to Starknet and Cairo, and provide recommendations on how to prevent them from affecting your contracts. 

Contributions to this chapter are welcome. If you have any suggestions, please submit a pull request to the https://github.com/starknet-edu/starknetbook[Book repo].

== 1. Access Control

Access control vulnerabilities arise when a smart contract's functions are inadequately secured, allowing unauthorized users to perform actions that should be restricted. This can lead to unintended smart contract behavior and manipulation of sensitive data.

For example, consider a smart contract that handles token minting without proper access control:

[source,rust]
----
#[external]
fn mint_tokens(amount: u256) {
    total_supply::write(total_supply::read() + amount);
}
----

In this example, any user can call the `mint_tokens` function and mint new tokens, potentially leading to an exploit or manipulation of the token supply.

To mitigate access control vulnerabilities, implement proper authorization mechanisms such as role-based access control (RBAC) or ownership checks. You can create your own custom solution or use existing templates like those provided by https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts-cairo/0.6.1/access[OpenZeppelin,window=_blank].

In the example above, we can add an owner variable, set the owner value in the constructor, and add an assert condition in the `mint_tokens` function to ensure that only the owner can mint new tokens.

[source,rust]
----
struct Storage {
    owner: ContractAddress,
}

#[constructor]
fn constructor() {
    let sender = get_caller_address();
    owner::write(sender);
}

#[external]
fn mint_tokens(amount: u256) {
    let sender = get_caller_address();
    assert(sender == owner::read());
    total_supply::write(total_supply::read() + amount);
}
----

By implementing proper access control, you can ensure that your smart contract functions are only executed by authorized parties, reducing the risk of unauthorized manipulation.

**Recommendation**

}

#[constructor]
fn constructor() {
    let sender = get_caller_address();
    owner::write(sender);
}

#[external]
fn mint_tokens(amount: u256) {
    let sender = get_caller_address();
    assert(sender == owner::read());
    total_supply::write(total_supply::read() + amount);
}
----

By implementing proper access control, you can ensure that your smart contract functions are only executed by authorized parties, reducing the risk of unauthorized manipulation.

== 2. Reentrancy

Reentrancy vulnerabilities occur when a smart contract's function calls an external contract before updating its internal state, allowing the external contract to recursively call the initial function before it has completed execution.

For example, consider a game contract where whitelisted addresses can mint an NFT sword and execute an `on_receive_sword()` function to use it before returning it to the contract. However, the NFT contract is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks, allowing an attacker to mint multiple NFT swords.

[source,rust]
----
#[constructor]
fn constructor() {
    available_swords::write(100);
}

#[external]
fn mint_one_sword() {
    let sender = get_caller_address();
    if whitelisted::read(sender) == true {
        // Update sword count
        let sword_count = available_swords::read();
        available_swords::write(sword_count - 1);
        // Mint one sword to caller
        sword::write(sender, 1);
        // Callback to sender
        let callback = ICallerDispatcher { contract_address: sender }.on_receive_sword();
        // Remove sender from whitelist
        whitelisted::write(sender, false);
    }
}
----

An attacker's contract can implement the `on_receive_sword` function to exploit the reentrancy vulnerability and mint multiple swords:

[source,rust]
----
#[external]
fn on_receive_sword() {
    let nft_sword_contract = get_caller_address();
    let call_number: felt252 = total_calls::read();
    total_calls::write(call_number + 1);
    if call_number < 10 {
        let call = ISwordDispatcher { contract_address: nft_sword_contract }.mint_one_sword();
    }
}
----

Reentrancy may need to be implemented in callback functions in many ERC standards with `safeTransfer` functions (ERC721, ERC777, ERC1155, ERC223, etc.) or in flash loans where lender contracts callback the borrower contract to use and return funds.

**Recommendation:**

To mitigate reentrancy vulnerabilities, follow the check-effects-interactions pattern, ensuring that you update the relevant internal state before calling external contracts. In the example above, remove the sender from the whitelist before calling the external function.

[source,rust]
----
if whitelisted::read(sender) == true {
    // Update sword count
    let sword_count = available_swords::read();
    available_swords::write(sword_count - 1);
    // Mint one sword to caller
    sword::write(sender, 1);
    // Remove sender from whitelist (before calling external function)
    whitelisted::write(sender, false);
    // Callback to sender (after setting all effects)
    let callback = ICallerDispatcher { contract_address: sender }.on_receive_sword();
}
----

By following the check-effects-interactions pattern, you can reduce the risk of reentrancy attacks, ensuring the integrity of your smart contract's internal state.

[id="tx_origin_authentication"]

== 3. Tx.Origin Authentication

In Solidity, `tx.origin` is a global variable that stores the address of the transaction initiator, while `msg.sender` stores the address of the transaction caller. In Cairo, we have the `account_contract_address` global variable and `get_caller_address` function, which serve the same purpose.

Using `account_contract_address` (the equivalent of `tx.origin`) for authentication in your smart contract functions can lead to phishing attacks. Attackers can create custom smart contracts and trick users into placing them as intermediaries in a transaction call, effectively impersonating the contract owner.

For example, consider a Cairo smart contract that allows transferring funds to the owner and uses `account_contract_address` for authentication:

[source,rust]
----
use starknet::get_caller_address;
use box::BoxTrait;

struct Storage {
    owner: ContractAddress,
}

#[constructor]
fn constructor(){
    // Set contract deployer as the owner
    let contract_deployer = get_caller_address();
    owner::write(contract_deployer)
}

#[external]
fn transferTo(to: ContractAddress, amount: u256) {
    let tx_info = starknet::get_tx_info().unbox();
    let authorizer: ContractAddress = tx_info.account_contract_address;
    assert(authorizer == owner::read());
    balance::write(to + amount);
}
----

An attacker can trick the owner into using a malicious contract, allowing the attacker to call the `transferTo` function and impersonate the contract owner:

[source,rust]
----
mod malicious_contract {
...
...
    #[external]
    fn transferTo(to: ContractAddress, amount: u256) {
        let callback = ICallerDispatcher { contract_address: sender }.transferTo(ATTACKER_ACCOUNT, amount);
    }
}
----

**Recommendation:**

Replace `account_contract_address` (origin) authentication with `get_caller_address` (sender) in the `transferTo` function to prevent phishing attacks:

[source,rust]
----
use starknet::get_caller_address;

struct Storage {
    owner: ContractAddress,
}

#[constructor]
fn constructor(){
    // Set contract deployer as the owner
    let contract_deployer = get_caller_address();
    owner::write(contract_deployer)
}

#[external]
fn transferTo(to: ContractAddress, amount: u256) {
    let authorizer = get_caller_address();
    assert(authorizer == owner::read());
    balance::write(to + amount);
}
----

By using the correct authentication method, you can prevent phishing attacks and ensure that only authorized users can execute specific smart contract functions.

== 4. Overflow/Underflow.

This vulnerability is related to assigning a variable a value that is larger (overflow) or smaller (underflow) than the one supported 
by the underlying data type. For example, if we use felt252 data type and add or substract a value out of range:

[source,rust]
----
    #[view]
    fn overflow_felt252() -> felt252 {
        // Assign max felt252 value = 2^251 + 17 * 2^192
        let max: felt252 = 3618502788666131106986593281521497120414687020801267626233049500247285301248 + 17 * 6277101735386680763835789423207666416102355444464034512896;
        return (max + 3);
    }

    #[view]
    fn underflow_felt252() -> felt252 {
        let min: felt252 = 0;
        // Assign max felt252 value = 2^251 + 17 * 2^192
        let substract = (3618502788666131106986593281521497120414687020801267626233049500247285301248 + 17 * 6277101735386680763835789423207666416102355444464034512896); 
        return (min - substract);
    }  
----

Then we will get wrong values:

image::sec_over_felt.png[felt252]

**Recommendation.**

Use protected data types as u128 or u256:

[source,rust]
----
    #[view]
    fn overflow_u256() -> u256 {
        let max_u128: u128 = 0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff_u128;
        let max: u256 = u256 { low: max_u128, high: max_u128 }; // Assign max u256 value
        let three: u256 = u256 { low: 3_u128, high: 0_u128 }; // Assign 3 value
        return (max + three);
    }

    #[view]
    fn underflow_u256() -> u256 {
        let min: u256 = u256 { low: 0_u128, high: 0_u128 }; // Assign 0 value
        let three: u256 = u256 { low: 3_u128, high: 0_u128 }; // Assign 3 value
        return (min - three);
    }
----

If we execute this functions our transaction will be reverted if an overflow is detected:

image::sec_over_u256.png[u256]
image::sec_over_u256.png[u256]


Where failure reason:
[source,rust]
----
0x753235365f616464204f766572666c6f77=u256_add Overflow
0x753235365f737562204f766572666c6f77=u256_sub Overflow
----
Same thing with u128:

[source,rust]
----
    #[view]
    fn overflow_u128() -> u128 {
        let max: u128 = 0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff_u128; // Assign max u128 value
        return (max + 3_u128);
    }

    #[view]
    fn underflow_u128() -> u128 {
        let min: u128 = 0_u128;
        return (min - 3_u128);
    }
----

Transaction reverted with failure reason:

image::sec_over_u128.png[u128]
image::sec_over_u128.png[u128]

Where:
[source,rust]
----
0x753132385f616464204f766572666c6f77=u128_add Overflow
0x753132385f737562204f766572666c6f77=u128_sub Overflow
