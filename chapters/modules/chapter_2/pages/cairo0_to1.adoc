= Migrating Cairo 0 to Cairo 1: A Tool for Conversion

Migrating code from Cairo 0 to Cairo 1 can be a challenging task. To facilitate this process, the Starknet Community introduces a tool for converting Cairo 0 code to Cairo 1 (https://github.com/tensojka/cairo-migration-prompt[link to original repository]).

== How to Use the Tool

To use the tool, follow these steps:

. Prompt your AI UI, for example ChatGPT with GPT-4, with the https://github.com/tensojka/cairo-migration-prompt/blob/main/preamble.txt[`preamble.txt`] file which contains a summary of the differences between Cairo 0 and Cairo 1. This step helps the tool to better understand the necessary migrations.
. Prompt your Cairo 0 code using the following format:

[source,plaintext]
----
Rewrite code below to c1. No talk; just go.
<c0> YOUR CODE HERE </c0><c1>
----

This will prompt the tool to convert your Cairo 0 code to Cairo 1. Note that referring to the languages as c0 and c1 is necessary, as using the term "Cairo" may cause confusion due to its outdated 2021 syntax.

== Where to Use the Tool

You can use the tool with ChatGPT Plus or [nat.dev](https://nat.dev), where you can pay $5 for pay-as-you-go access to GPT-4 and claude-v1, both of which are suitable for this task.

== Limitations of the Tool

The 4k token context window of ChatGPT GPT-4 may be insufficient for explaining Cairo 1. To stay within this limit, it is recommended to edit your prompts in ChatGPT rather than conversing with the model to save context. If you exceed the token limit in ChatGPT, the output will be cut off, and you will need to say "Continue" or similar.

GPT-4 on [nat.dev](https://nat.dev) offers an 8k token context window.

== Development Resources

You can check token counts at the [tiktoken calculator](https://huggingface.co/spaces/JacobLinCool/tiktoken-calculator). Try to keep the preamble under 3k tokens to avoid exceeding the token limit.

This chapter introduces a tool for converting Cairo 0 code to Cairo 1. By following the steps outlined above and understanding the tool's limitations, you can efficiently migrate your Cairo 0 code to the latest version of the language.
