= Smart Contracts in Cairo

As we delve into the world of Starknet, we find that the platform relies on a powerful and expressive programming language called Cairo. Designed specifically for scaling decentralized applications (dApps) using STARKs, Cairo is a Turing-complete language that enables developers to harness the power of highly efficient and scalable zero-knowledge proofs. In this chapter, we will explore Cairo in the context of Starknet. We will learn about the core concepts of Cairo, its differences from Solidity, the structure and components of Cairo smart contracts, and the unique features of the Starknet network.

By the end of this chapter, you will have a comprehensive understanding of the fundamental concepts and components of Cairo, enabling you to build robust and efficient smart contracts on Starknet.

== What Is a Cairo Smart Contract?

In the Starknet ecosystem, the term _smart contract_ refers to immutable computer programs that run deterministically within the context of a Starknet Operating System. These programs are written in the Cairo language and are deployed on Starknet.

Letâ€™s break down the key aspects of Cairo smart contracts:

Computer programs::
Cairo smart contracts are simply computer programs, designed to execute within the context of Starknet.

Immutable::
Once deployed, the code of a Cairo smart contract cannot change. Just as with Ethereum smart contracts, the only way to modify a Cairo smart contract is to deploy a new instance.

Deterministic::
The outcome of the execution of a Cairo smart contract is the same for everyone who runs it, given the context of the transaction that initiated its execution and the state of the Starknet network at the moment of execution.

Starknet Operating System context::
Cairo smart contracts operate within the context of a Starknet Operating System (Starknet OS). They can access their own state, the context of the transaction that called them, and some information about the most recent blocks.

== Solidity vs. Cairo: Overcoming Limitations and Embracing Scalability

While Solidity is a widely adopted language for smart contract development and supports a range of applications, it was not designed for provable computation. As a result, compilers that translate idiomatic Solidity code into proofs encounter several challenges:

1. Reliance on inefficient data structures, such as uint256, and operations on them
2. Mutability at the language level
3. Lack of efficient built-ins
4. No low-level access

In practice, there are two different technologies for proving general programs: SNARKs and STARKs. Instruction sets favored by SNARKs are better suited as a compilation target for languages like Solidity. However, STARKs offer more scalability while having a less natural instruction set. This means that Solidity can be efficiently encoded to SNARKs but not as optimally to STARKs, as constructs common in Solidity are "costly" for STARKs.

Cairo addresses these limitations and offers more efficient solutions:

1. A low-level field data type called "felt252" is available, alongside a several types of uints
2. Cairo is idiomatically write-once, resembling a functional programming language
3. Cairo provides full low-level access to underlying primitives

Although the ecosystem tools are still maturing, it is essential to transcend existing limitations and build better composable applications. Cairo's focus on overcoming Solidity's limitations in provable computation and embracing the scalability of STARKs makes it a more suitable choice for developers looking to create the next generation of decentralized applications.

== Programming in Cairo

One of the key inspirations for Cairo's syntax is Rust, a popular systems programming language known for its performance, reliability, and strong focus on safety. Developers familiar with Rust will find it easy to transition to Cairo, as many of the language's features and concepts are similar.

However, even if you are not familiar with Rust, learning Cairo is still a straightforward process. The language is designed with simplicity and clarity in mind, making it accessible to developers with varying levels of experience. As you delve into Cairo, you'll discover a growing community of passionate developers who are constantly creating new educational materials, tools, and resources to make the learning experience as smooth as possible for newcomers.

This ecosystem continues to grow and thrive. Each week, new materials and tooling are developed to help both experienced programmers and beginners alike to learn, understand, and build with Cairo.

In the following sections, we will explore the core concepts and components of Cairo.
