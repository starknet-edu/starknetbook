= Data Availability

The data availability problem:

* STARK proofs generate a proof of computation.
 ** ex: valid execution from genesis to block 100
* you don't need the output of the program to validate the program ran correctly
 ** ex: state of block 100
* my contract logic requires the state of block 100
 ** ex: if we don't have the state of block 100 "stored" somewhere our contract is essentially stuck

*Solution: Validity Rollup - store the state on secure L1*

* current state of Starknet
* periodically store the rollup state to Ethereum
* inherit the security of the base chain

*Solution: Validium - store data "off chain"*

* IPFS, Celestia, cloud providers
* can secure with a Data Availablility Committee(DAC)
* data can be private
* less expensive

*Solution: Volition - hybrid*

* single chain can dynamically chose where data is stored
* application flexibility
* composability implications
