= SHARP (Shared Prover) in Starknet

SHARP is like public transportation for proofs on Starknet, aggregating multiple Cairo programs to save costs and boost efficiency. It uses recursive proofs, allowing parallelization and optimization, making it more affordable for all users. Critical services like the gateway, validator, and Prover work together with a stateless design for flexibility. SHARP’s adoption by StarkEx, Starknet, and external users (trough the Cairo Playground) highlights its significance and potential for future optimization.

This chapter will discuss SHARP, how it has evolved to incorporate recursive proofs, and its role in reducing costs and improving efficiency within the Starknet network.

== What is SHARP?

SHARP, which stands for "Shared Prover", is a mechanism used in Starknet that aggregates multiple Cairo programs from different users, each containing different logic. These Cairo programs are then executed together, generating a single proof common to all the programs. Rather than sending the proof directly to the Solidity Verifier in Ethereum, it is initially sent to a STARK Verifier program written in Cairo. The STARK Verifier generates a new proof to confirm that the initial proofs were verified, which can be sent back into SHARP and the STARK Verifier. This recursive proof process will be discussed in more detail later in this chapter. Ultimately, the last proof in the series is sent to the Solidity Verifier on Ethereum. In other words, there are many proofs generated until we reach Ethereum and the Solidity Verifier.

The primary benefit of SHARP system lies in its ability to decrease costs and enhance efficiency within the Starknet network. It achieves this by aggregating multiple Cairo jobs, which are individual sets of computations. This aggregation allows the protocol to leverage the exponential amortization offered by STARK proofs.

Exponential amortization means that as the computational load of the proofs increases, the cost of verifying those proofs rises at a slower logarithmic rate than the computation increase. In other words, the computation itself grows slower than the verification cost. As a result, the cost of each transaction within the aggregated set is significantly reduced, making the overall process more cost-effective and accessible for users.

[NOTE]
====
In SHARP and Cairo context, "jobs" refer to the individual Cairo programs or tasks submitted by different users. These jobs contain specific logic or computations that must be executed on the Starknet network.
====

Additionally, SHARP allows smaller users with limited computation to benefit from joining other jobs and share the cost of generating the proofs. This collaborative approach is similar to using public transportation instead of a private car, where the cost is distributed among all participants, making it more affordable for everyone.

== Recursive Proofs in SHARP

One of the most powerful features of SHARP is its use of recursive proofs. Rather than directly sending the generated proofs to the Solidity Verifier, they are first sent to a STARK Verifier program written in Cairo. This Verifier, which is also a Cairo Program, receives the proof and creates a new Cairo job that is sent to the Prover. The Prover then generates a new proof to confirm that the initial proofs were verified. These new proofs can be sent back into SHARP and the STARK Verifier, restarting the process.

This process continues recursively, with each new proof being sent to the Cairo Verifier until a trigger is reached. At this point, the last proof in the series is sent to the Solidity Verifier on Ethereum. This approach allows for greater parallelization of the computation and reduces the time and cost associated with generating and verifying proofs.

At first glance, recursive proofs may seem more complex and time-consuming. However, there are several benefits to this approach:

. *Parallelization*: Recursive proofs allow for work parallelization, reducing user latency and improving SHARP efficiency.
. *Cheaper on-chain costs*: Parallelization enables SHARP to create larger proofs, which would have previously been limited by the availability of large cloud machines (which are rare and limited). As a result, on-chain costs are reduced.
. *Lower cloud costs*: Since each job is shorter, the required memory for processing is reduced, resulting in lower cloud costs.
. *Optimization*: Recursive proofs enable SHARP to optimize for various factors, including latency, on-chain costs, and time to proof.
. *Cairo support*: Recursive proofs only require support in Cairo, without the need to add support in the Solidity Verifier.


[NOTE]
====
Latency in Starknet encompasses the time taken for processing, confirming, and including transactions in a block. It is affected by factors like network congestion, transaction fees, and system efficiency. Minimizing latency ensures faster transaction processing and user feedback.

Time to proof, however, specifically pertains to the duration required to generate and verify cryptographic proofs for transactions or operations.

== SHARP Backend Architecture and Data Pipeline

SHARP back end architecture consists of several services that work together to process Cairo jobs and generate proofs. These services include:

. *Gateway*: Cairo jobs enter SHARP through the gateway.
. *Validator*: This is the first important step. The validator service runs validation checks on each job, ensuring they meet the requirements and can fit within the prover machines. Invalid jobs are tagged as such and do not proceed to the Prover.
. *Scheduler*: The scheduler service creates "trains" that aggregate jobs and send them to the Prover. Recursive jobs are paired and sent to the Prover together.
. *Cairo Runner*: This service runs Cairo for the Prover’s needs. The Cairo Runner service runs Cairo programs, executing the necessary computations and generating the execution trace as an intermediate result. The Prover then uses this execution trace.
. *Prover*: The Prover computes the proofs for each train (that contains a few jobs).
. *Dispatcher*: The Dispatcher serves two functions in the SHARP system. 
    .. In the case of a recursive proof, the Dispatcher runs the Cairo Verifier program on the proof it has received from the Prover, resulting in a new Cairo job that goes back to the Validator.
    .. In the case of a proof that needs to go on chain (e.g., to Ethereum), the Dispatcher creates "packages" from the proof, which can then be sent to the Blockchain Writer. 
. *Blockchain Writer*: Once the packages have been created by the Dispatcher, they are sent to the Blockchain Writer. The Blockchain Writer is responsible for sending the packages to the appropriate blockchain (e.g., Ethereum) for verification. This is an important step in the SHARP system, as it ensures that the proofs are properly validated and that the transactions are securely recorded on the blockchain.
. *Catcher*: The Catcher monitors blockchain (e.g., Ethereum) transactions to ensure that they have been accepted. This is another critical component of the SHARP system, as it ensures that the entire transaction process is completed successfully and that the proofs are properly validated.

SHARP is designed to be stateless (each Cairo job is executed in its own context and has no dependency on other jobs), allowing for greater flexibility in processing jobs.

== Current SHARP Users

Currently, the primary users of SHARP include:

* StarkEx
* Starknet
* External users who use the Cairo Playground

== Challenges and Optimization

Optimizing the Prover involves numerous challenges and potential projects on which the Starkware team and the community are currently working:

* Exploring more efficient hash functions: SHARP is constantly exploring more efficient hash functions for Cairo, the Prover, and Solidity.
* Investigating smaller fields: Investigating smaller fields for recursive proof steps could lead to more efficient computations.
* Adjusting various parameters: SHARP is continually adjusting various parameters of the STARK protocol, such as FRI parameters and block factors.
* Optimizing the Cairo code: SHARP is optimizing the Cairo code to make it faster, resulting in a faster recursive prover.
* Developing dynamic layouts: This will allow Cairo programs to scale resources depending on their needs.
* Improving scheduling algorithm: This is another optimization path that can be taken. It is not within the Prover itself.

In particular, dynamic layouts (you can learn more about layouts here (TODO)) will allow Cairo programs to scale resources depending on their needs. This can lead to more efficient computation and better utilization of resources. Dynamic layouts allow SHARP to determine the required resources for a specific job and adjust the layout accordingly instead of relying on predefined layouts with fixed resources. This approach can provide tailored solutions for each job, improving overall efficiency.

== Conclusion

In conclusion, SHARP is a critical component of Starknet’s architecture, providing a more efficient and cost-effective solution for processing Cairo programs and verifying their proofs. By leveraging the power of STARK technology and incorporating recursive proofs, SHARP plays a vital role in improving the overall performance and scalability of the Starknet network. The stateless nature of SHARP and the reliance on the cryptographic soundness of the STARK proving system make it an innovative and valuable addition to the blockchain ecosystem.
