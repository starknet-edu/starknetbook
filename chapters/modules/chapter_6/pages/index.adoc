= Running a Starknet Node

This chapter will guide you through setting up and running a Starknet node, illustrating the layered tech stack concept, and explaining how to operate these protocols locally. Starknet, as a Layer 2 Validity Rollup, operates on top of Ethereum Layer 1, creating a protocol stack that each addresses different functionalities, similar to the OSI model for internet connections. This chapter is an edit of https://medium.com/starknet-edu/the-starknet-stack-7b0d70a7e1d4[drspacemn]'s blog.

== What is a Node in the Context of Ethereum and Blockchain?

In the context of Ethereum and blockchain, a node is an integral part of the network that validates and relays transactions. Nodes download a copy of the entire blockchain and are interconnected with other nodes to maintain and update the blockchain state. There are different types of nodes, such as full nodes, light nodes, and mining nodes, each having different roles and responsibilities within the network.

== Overview of Starknet Technology

Starknet is a permissionless, zk-STARK-based Layer-2 network, aiming for full decentralization. It enables developers to build scalable decentralized applications (dApps) and utilizes Ethereum's Layer 1 for proof verification and data availability. Key aspects of Starknet include:

* *Cairo execution environment*: Cairo, the execution environment of Starknet, facilitates writing and execution of complex smart contracts.
* *Scalability*: Starknet achieves scalability through zk-STARK proofs, minimizing the data needed to be posted on-chain.
* *Node network*: The Starknet network comprises nodes that synchronize and process transactions, contributing to the network's overall security and decentralization.

== Starknet Stack

The Starknet stack can be divided into various layers, similar to OSI or TCP/IP models. The most appropriate model depends on your understanding and requirements. A simplified version of the modular blockchain stack might look like this:

- Layer 1: Data Layer
- Layer 2: Execution Layer
- Layer 3: Application Layer
- Layer 4: Transport Layer

== Setup

There are various hardware specifications, including packaged options, that will enable you to run an Ethereum node from home. The goal here is to build the most cost-efficient Starknet stack possible (https://github.com/rocket-pool/docs.rocketpool.net/blob/main/src/guides/node/local/hardware.md[see here more options]).

*Minimum Requirements:*

- CPU: 2+ cores

Recommended operating system and software: Ubuntu LTS, https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu[Docker], and https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/linux[Docker Compose]. Ensure you have the necessary tools installed with:

[source,bash]
----
sudo apt install -y jq curl net-tools
----

== Layer 1: Data Layer

The bottom-most layer of the stack is the data layer. Here, Starknet's L2 leverages Ethereum's L1 for proof verification and data availability. Starknet utilizes Ethereum as its L1, so the first step is setting up an Ethereum Full Node. As this is the data layer, the hardware bottleneck is usually the disk storage. It's crucial to have a high capacity I/O SSD over an HDD because Ethereum Nodes require both an Execution Client and a Consensus Client for communication.

Ethereum provides several options for Execution and Consensus clients. Execution clients include Geth, Erigon, Besu (used here), Nethermind, and Akula. Consensus clients include Prysm, Lighthouse (used here), Lodestar, Nimbus, and Teku.

Your Besu/Lighthouse node will take approximately 600 GB of disk space. Navigate to a partition on your machine with sufficient capacity and run the following commands:

[source,bash]
----
git clone git@github.com:starknet-edu/starknet-stack.git
cd starknet-stack
docker compose -f dc-l1.yaml up -d 
----

This will begin the fairly long process of spinning up our Consensus Client, Execution Client, and syncing them to the current state of the Goerli Testnet. If you would like to see the logs from either process you can run:

[source,bash]
----
# tail besu logs
docker container logs -f $(docker ps | grep besu | awk '{print $1}')

# tail lighthouse logs
docker container logs -f $(docker ps | grep lighthouse | awk '{print $1}')
----

Lets make sure that everything that should be listening is listening:

[source,bash]
----
# should see all ports in commanad output

# besu ports
sudo netstat -lpnut | grep -E '30303|8551|8545'

# lighthouse ports
sudo netstat -lpnut | grep -E '5054|9000'
[source,bash]
----

We’ve used docker to abscract a lot of the nuance of running a Eth L1 node, but the important things to note are how the two processes EL/CL point to each other and communicate via JSON-RPC:

[source,bash]
----
services:
  lighthouse:
      image: sigp/lighthouse:latest
      container_name: lighthouse
      volumes:
        - ./l1_consensus/data:/root/.lighthouse
        - ./secret:/root/secret
      network_mode: "host"
      command:
        - lighthouse
        - beacon
        - --network=goerli
        - --metrics
        - --checkpoint-sync-url=https://goerli.beaconstate.info
        - --execution-endpoint=http://127.0.0.1:8551
        - --execution-jwt=/root/secret/jwt.hex

  besu:
    image: hyperledger/besu:latest
    container_name: besu
    volumes:
      - ./l1_execution/data:/var/lib/besu
      - ./secret:/var/lib/besu/secret
    network_mode: "host"
    command:
      - --network=goerli
      - --rpc-http-enabled=true
      - --data-path=/var/lib/besu
      - --data-storage-format=BONSAI
      - --sync-mode=X_SNAP
      - --engine-rpc-enabled=true
      - --engine-jwt-enabled=true
      - --engine-jwt-secret=/var/lib/besu/secret/jwt.hex
----

Once this is done, your Ethereum node should be up and running, and it will start syncing with the Ethereum network.

== Layer 2: Execution Layer

The next layer in our Starknet stack is the Execution Layer. This layer is responsible for running the Cairo VM, which executes Starknet smart contracts. The Cairo VM is a deterministic virtual machine that allows developers to write complex smart contracts in the Cairo language. Starknet uses a similar https://github.com/starkware-libs/starknet-specs[JSON-RPC spec] as https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc[Ethereum] in order to interact with the execution layer. 

In order to stay current with the propagation of the Starknet blockchain we need a client similar to Besu that we are using for L1. The efforts to provide full nodes for the Starknet ecosystem are: https://github.com/eqlabs/pathfinder[Pathfinder] (used here), https://github.com/starkware-libs/papyrus[Papyrus], and https://github.com/NethermindEth/juno[Juno]. However, different implementations are still in development and not yet ready for production.

Check that your L1 has completed its sync:

[source,bash]
----
# check goerli etherscan to make sure you have the latest block

curl --location --request POST 'http://localhost:8545' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "jsonrpc":"2.0",
    "method":"eth_blockNumber",
    "params":[],
    "id":83
}'
----

Start your L2 Execution Client and note that we are syncing Starknet’s state from our LOCAL ETH L1 NODE!

[note]
====
PATHFINDER_ETHEREUM_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8545
====

[source,bash]
----
# from starknet-stack project root
docker compose -f dc-l2.yaml up -d
----

To follow the sync:

[source,bash]
----
docker container logs -f $(docker ps | grep pathfinder | awk '{print $1}')
----

Starknet Testnet_1 currently comprises ~600,000 blocks so this will take some time to sync fully. To check L2 sync:

[source,bash]
----
# compare `current_block_num` with `highest_block_num`

curl --location --request POST 'http://localhost:9545' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
 "jsonrpc":"2.0",
 "method":"starknet_syncing",
 "params":[],
 "id":1
}'
----

To check data sizes:

[source,bash]
----
sudo du -sh ./* | sort -rh
----

== Layer 3: Application Layer

We see the same need for data refinement as we did in the OSI model. On L1 packets come over the wire in a raw stream of bytes and are then processed and filtered by higher-level protocols. When designing a decentralized application Bob will need to be cognizant of interactions with his contract on chain, but doesn’t need to be aware of all the information occurring on Starknet.

This is the role of an indexer. To process and filter useful information for an application. Information that an application MUST be opinionated about and the underlying layer MUST NOT be opinionated about.

Indexers provide applications flexibility as they can be written in any programming language and have any data layout that suites the application.

To start our toy https://github.com/starknet-edu/starknet-stack/blob/main/indexer/indexer.sh[indexer] run:

[source,bash]
----
./indexer/indexer.sh
----

Again notice that we don’t need to leave our local setup for these interactions (http://localhost:9545).    

== Layer 4: Transport Layer

The transport layer comes into play when the application has parsed and indexed critical information, often leading to some state change based on this information. This is where the application communicates the desired state change to the Layer 2 sequencer to get that change into a block. This is achieved using the same full-node/RPC spec implementation, in our case, Pathfinder.

When working with our local Starknet stack, invoking a transaction locally might look like this:

[source,bash]
----
curl --location --request POST 'http://localhost:9545' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "starknet_addInvokeTransaction",
    "params": {
        "invoke_transaction": {
            "type": "INVOKE",
            "max_fee": "0x4f388496839",
            "version": "0x0",
            "signature": [

                "0x71456dded17015d1234779889d78f3e7c763ddcfd2662b19e7843c7542614f8"
            ],
            "contract_address": "0x23371b227eaecd8e8920cd429d2cd0f3fee6abaacca08d3ab82a7cdd",
            "calldata": [
                "0x1",
                "0x677bb1cdc050e8d63855e8743ab6e09179138def390676cc03c484daf112ba1",
                "0x362398bec32bc0ebb411203221a35a0301193a96f317ebe5e40be9f60d15320",
                "0x0",
                "0x1",
                "0x1",
                "0x2b",
                "0x0"
            ],
            "entry_point_selector": "0x15d40a3d6ca2ac30f4031e42be28da9b056fef9bb7357ac5e85627ee876e5ad"
        }
    },
    "id": 0
}'
----

However, this process involves setting up a local wallet and signing the transaction. For simplicity, we will use a browser wallet and StarkScan.

Steps:

. Navigate to the contract on StarkScan and connect to your wallet.
. Enter a new value and write the transaction:

image::node2.png[node2]

Once the transaction is accepted on the Layer 2 execution layer, the event data should come through our application layer indexer.

Example Indexer Output:

[source,bash]
----
Pulled Block #: 638703
Found transaction: 0x2053ae75adfb4a28bf3a01009f36c38396c904012c5fc38419f4a7f3b7d75a5

Once the transaction is accepted on Layer 1, we can query the Starknet Core Contracts from our Layer 1 node to see the storage keys that have been updated on our data layer!

You have successfully navigated through the entire Starknet stack, from setting up your node, through executing and monitoring a transaction, to inspecting its effects on the data layer. This journey has equipped you with the understanding and the skills to interact with Starknet on a deeper level.

== Conclusion: Understanding the Modular Nature of Starknet

Conceptual models, such as the ones used in this guide, are incredibly useful in helping us understand complex systems. They can be refactored, reformed, and nested to provide a clear and comprehensive view of how a platform like Starknet operates. For instance, the OSI Model, a foundational model for understanding network interactions, underpins our modular stack.

A key concept to grasp is 'Fractal Scaling.' This concept allows us to extend our model to include additional layers beyond Layer 2, such as Layer 3. In this extended model, the entire stack recurs above our existing stack, as shown in the following diagram:

image::node3.png[node3]

Just as Layer 2 compresses its transaction throughput into a proof and state change that is written to Layer 1, we can apply the same compression principle at Layer 3, proving and writing to Layer 2. This not only gives us more control over the protocol rules but also allows us to achieve higher compression ratios, enhancing the scalability of our applications.

In essence, Starknet's modular and layered design, combined with the power of Fractal Scaling, offers a robust and scalable framework for building decentralized applications. Understanding this structure is fundamental to effectively leveraging Starknet's capabilities and contributing to its ecosystem.

This concludes our journey into running a Starknet node and traversing its layered architecture. We hope that you now feel equipped to explore, experiment with, and innovate within the Starknet ecosystem.
