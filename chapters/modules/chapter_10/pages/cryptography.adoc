A party (P) executing a computation (C) on a dataset (D) may have incentive to misreport the correct output (C(D)), raising the problem of computational integrity (CI) (also known as delegation of computation, certified computation, and verifiable computation). That is, ensuring that P indeed reports C(D) rather than an output more favorable to P.

When the dataset D is public, any party (V) interested in verifying CI can re-execute C on D and compare its output to that reported by P, as a customer might inspect a restaurant bill, or as a new Ethereum node will verify its blockchain.  This solution does not scale because the time spent by the verifier (TV) is as large as the time required to execute the program (TC) and V must read the full dataset D. Thus, the computational integrity solution we seek should have scalable verification.

Additionally, when the dataset D contains confidential data, the previous solution can no longer be implemented and the
party P in charge of D may conceal violations of computational integrity under the veil of secrecy.

Zero knowledge (ZK) proof and argument systems are automated protocols that guarantee computational integrity over confidential data for any efficient computation, eliminating corruptibility (possibly of auditors) and reducing costs. A ZK system S for a computation C is a pair of randomized algorithms, S = (P, V); the prover P is the algorithm used to prove computational integrity and the verifier V checks such proofs. Ideally we want the proof to be succint: the proof should be quicker to verify than than computing it.

The completeness and soundness of S imply that P can efficiently prove all truisms but will fail to convince V of any falsities (with all but negligible probability).

=== Terminology

Zero Knowledge Proof Systems are proof systems in which there is secret information known to the `prover` that is not known to the `verifier`, and the verifier is still convinced of the computational claim.

A `non-interactive` proof system is an abstract machine that models computation between the two parties(prover and verifier).

A `succinct` proof system is one in which the verifier can run an order of magnitute faster than a naive re-execution of the program

`SNARKS`: Succint Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge

`STARKs`: Scalable Transparent Arguments of Knowledge

=== SNARKs

SNARK means Succinct Non-interactive Argument of Knowledge. They were pushed by a 2012 paper from https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2090236.2090263[Alessandro Chiesa et. al.]. Alessandro is Co-Founder and Scientific Advisor at StarkWare.  SNARKs use elliptic curves to secure the randomness required for a proof. Elliptic curves are collision resistant, which means that it is very hard to find two separate inputs that produce the same output (https://pseudotheos.mirror.xyz/_LAi4cCFz2gaC-3WgNmri1eTvckA32L7v31A8saJvqg[pseudotheos, 2022]).

The main limitations of SNARKs are:

. No post-quantum resistance.
. Initial trust requirements.

== STARKS: The newer and shinier cousin of SNARKs

https://vitalik.ca/general/2017/11/09/starks_part_1.html[Vitalik (2017)] - "What you might not know is that ZK-SNARKs have a newer, shinier cousin: ZK-STARKs."
____

STARKs were introduced in 2018 in a https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/046.pdf[paper by Eli Ben-Sasson et. al.]. Eli is Co-Founder of StarkWare. That is right, StarkWare was founded by the some of the creators of both SNARKs and STARKs.

The main difference between SNARKs and STARKs is that a STARK uses collision resistant hash functions instead of elliptic curves. These are much simpler cryptographic assumptions. STARKs rely purely on hashes and information theory; meaning that they are secure against attackers with quantum computers (https://vitalik.ca/general/2017/11/09/starks_part_1.html[Vitalik, 2017]).

What is the downside? Mainly that proof sizes go uo from 288 bytes, in SNARKs case, to a few hundred kilobytes. The tradeoff could be worth it or not. Authors suggest it could be worth it because it  This tradeoff is worth STARKs allow us to have a much higher effective TPS and throughput than a SNARK (https://pseudotheos.mirror.xyz/_LAi4cCFz2gaC-3WgNmri1eTvckA32L7v31A8saJvqg[pseudotheos, 2022]), and if elliptic curves break or when quantum computers come around (https://vitalik.ca/general/2017/11/09/starks_part_1.html[Vitalik, 2017]).

"With the T standing for "transparent", ZK-STARKs resolve one of the primary weaknesses of ZK-SNARKs, its reliance on a 'trusted setupÂ´." https://vitalik.ca/general/2017/11/09/starks_part_1.html[(Vitalik 2017)].
