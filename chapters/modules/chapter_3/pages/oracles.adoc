= Oracles

Blockchains inherently lack the ability to read data from the internet. Nevertheless, many blockchain applications, such as DeFi apps, require constant access to up-to-date information from various online sources. Oracles bridge the gap between blockchains and external systems, allowing smart contracts to execute based on real-world inputs and outputs.

The two largest oracles on Starknet are the https://www.empiric.network/[Empiric Network] and the https://www.stork.network/[Stork Oracle Network].

== Empiric Network

The https://www.empiric.network/[Empiric Network] is a fully open-source and audited oracle network. It provides over 20 price feeds for popular crypto assets and has a well-established community of data providers, ensuring frequent updates.

== Stork Network

The https://www.stork.network/[Stork Network] is an on-chain price computation oracle, calculating token prices on-chain on StarkNet based on price quotes provided by individual publishers rather than aggregating them off-chain.

The network maintains a whitelist of publishers authorized to publish and sign data on-chain. Currently, only two publishers are live on the testnet, providing price updates: Dexterity, a financial firm in the crypto space, and Stork itself.

== Chainlink

https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/starknet[Chainlink Price Feeds] are available on the Starknet testnet, with plans for availability on the Starknet mainnet in the near future. Chainlink provides decentralized oracle services.
