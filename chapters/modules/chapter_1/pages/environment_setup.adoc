= Setting up your local development environment

== Pre-Requisites

At the time of writing this tutorial, Cairo 1.0  is at a very early stage and is prone to errors and bugs. Please be sure to fetch and update the repositories we mention below, regularly. 

The above repositories require you to have the following minimum prerequisites: +
- https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-390/[Python 3.9] +
- https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install[Rust] +

== CLI Installation

+++<strong>+++Step 1: Set up your virtual environment +++</strong>+++

We recommend working inside a Python virtual environment, but you can also install the Cairo package directly. To create and enter the virtual environment, type:

[,Bash]
----
#Activate your cairo virtual environment
python3.9 -m venv ~/cairo_venv
source ~/cairo_venv/bin/activate
----

Alternatively, you can also use the pyenv environment manager to create a virtual environment. To do so, run the following commands:

[,Bash]
----
#Install pyenv
curl https://pyenv.run | bash

#Add the following to your .bashrc or .zshrc
export PATH="$HOME/.pyenv/bin:$PATH"
eval "$(pyenv init -)"
eval "$(pyenv virtualenv-init -)"

#Restart your terminal and run the following commands
pyenv install 3.9.0
pyenv virtualenv 3.9.0 cairo_venv
pyenv activate cairo_venv
----

Either way, make sure the venv is activated â€“ you should see (cairo_venv) in the command line prompt. 
Your terminal should look like this:

+++<strong>+++Step 2: Install the necessary dependencies +++</strong>+++

On Ubuntu, for example, you will have to first run:

[,Bash]
----
sudo apt install -y libgmp3-dev
----

On Mac, you can use brew:

[,Bash]
----
brew install gmp
----

Finally, install the following dependencies:

[,Bash]
----
pip3 install ecdsa fastecdsa sympy
----

There might be some other libraries which are not direct dependencies but they might be indirect dependencies that you would need to install based on your operating system.


+++<strong>+++Step 3: Install cairo-lang CLI +++</strong>+++

If you had cairo-lang installed previously, uninstall it and install the latest downloaded version. To do so, you will have to download the file over https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo-lang/archive/refs/tags/v0.11.0.1.zip[here] and place it in your path so you can build locally. 

[,Bash]
----
#Uninstall the previous version
pip3 uninstall cairo-lang
#Build locally
pip3 install cairo-lang-0.11.0.1.zip
----

Once you have installed the cairo lang package and installed it, make sure to test your installation by running the following command:

[,Bash]
----
starknet --version
----

If you see a version starting with 0.11.0, then you have successfully installed the CLI.

NOTE: For M1 and M2 users, if you face any issues while running starknet --version command, 
then you may refer to https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/nile/issues/22[this] article to follow alternate steps to install the dependencies in Step 2.

== Cairo 1 Installation

+++<strong>+++Step1: Clone the cairo repository and set it up using the following instructions:+++</strong>+++

[,Bash]
----
# Clone the Cairo compiler to the $HOME directory
git clone https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo/

#Rename the cairo folder to .cairo in order to keep it hidden
mv cairo .cairo

#Checkout into the working branch and generate the release binaries
cd .cairo/
git checkout 9c190561ce1e8323665857f1a77082925c817b4c
cargo build --all --release

----

+++<strong>+++Step 2: Add Cairo 1.0 executables to your path:+++</strong>+++

Now that we have built the Cairo 1.0 binaries, we need to add them to the PATH environment variable. Add the following in your .bashrc or .zshrc:

[,Bash]
----
#Add the below command to your .bashrc or .zshrc
export PATH="$HOME/.cairo/target/release:$PATH"
----

After that, open a new shell and check that the following command returns a version number:

[,Bash]
----
cairo-compile --version
----

Your output should look something like this(not necessarily inside the cairo_venv):

Woohoo! Now we have everything we need to compile, deploy and interact with our first Cairo contract!
