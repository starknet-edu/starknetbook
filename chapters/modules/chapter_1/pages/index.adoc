= Getting Started with Cairo programming and Starknet contracts

Developers who finish this Chapter can build their own Cairo smart contracts and deploy them on the Starknet network.
We will learn everything required to code in Cairo, the language that lets you generate STARK proofs for general purpose computation on the Cairo OS (more on this at a later Chapter).
Then we will create and deploy a contract to allow DAO members to vote entirely on-chain.

After finishing this tutorial, try to hone your skills by earning all the points in the https://github.com/starknet-edu/starknet-cairo-101[Cairo 101] workshop, code your own https://github.com/starknet-edu/starknet-erc721[ERC721 (NFT)], deploy a customized https://github.com/starknet-edu/starknet-erc20[ERC20] and REV UP YOUR ENGINES with  https://github.com/shramee/starklings-cairo1[Starklinks]
