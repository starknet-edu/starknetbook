= A practically-efficient Turing-complete STARK-Friendly CPU Architecture

While this section is being built we recommend reading the video session for this chapter and the https://www.cairo-lang.org/docs/how_cairo_works/index.html[cairo-lang docs].

`Practical`: Cairo supports conditional branches, memory, function calls, and recursion

`Efficient`: Instruction Set chosen so the corresponding AIR is efficient and optimized with `builtins`

`Turing Complete`: Can simulate any Turing machine, as such supports any feasible computation
