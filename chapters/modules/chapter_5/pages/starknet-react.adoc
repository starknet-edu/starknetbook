= Starknet React

====
CONTRIBUTE: We are looking to add a concrete example of how to use Starknet React (likely in interaction with starknet.js). If you have a project that uses Starknet React, please submit a PR.
====

Developed by the [Apibara](https://github.com/apibara) team, Starknet React is an open-source collection of React providers and hooks for Starknet. 

To begin using Starknet-React, first install the appropriate package manager, PNPM:

[source, bash]
----
npm install -g pnpm
----

Next, modify a React boilerplate by running:

[source, bash]
----
pnpm add @starknet-react/core
pnpm add get-starknet starknet
----

Lastly, wrap the `App` object in your `index` file as follows:

[source, javascript]
----
import { StarknetConfig } from '@starknet-react/core'

function App() {
  return (
    <StarknetConfig>
      <YourApp />
    </StarknetConfig>
  )
}
----
