CONTRIBUTE: We are looking to add a concrete example of how to use Starknet Vue. If you have a project that uses Starknet React, please submit a PR.

The Starknet ecosystem offers frameworks suitable for both Vue and React. For those who prefer Vue, vue-stark-boil, developed by the team at [Don't Panic DAO](https://github.com/dontpanicdao), is a great option.

The vue-stark-boil boilerplate enables various functionalities, such as connecting to a wallet, listening for account changes, and calling a contract.

After cloning the project, ensure that you install all dependencies by running the following command in your terminal:
