# Examples

Here, we will explore numerous examples, elucidating the principles and
techniques to effectively design and implement Account contracts.

Before delving into the examples, we would like to issue a disclaimer:
the contracts discussed in this chapter are for illustrative and
educational purposes, and they have not undergone formal auditing. This
signifies that, while we strive to provide accurate and informative
content, the implementation of these contracts in a live environment
should be approached with due diligence. We encourage users to
thoroughly test and validate these contracts before their deployment on
the mainnet.

The goal of this chapter is not only to furnish a library of contract
examples but also to foster collaboration and knowledge sharing among
the Starknet community. We believe that the exchange of ideas and
constructive feedback is instrumental in advancing our collective
understanding and expertise.

If youâ€™ve developed or come across an innovative contract that could
serve as a valuable learning resource for others, we invite you to
contribute. Here are a few guidelines for your contribution:

1.  **Open a PR:** To submit a contract example or suggest changes to
    existing ones, simply open a Pull Request. Ensure that your PR
    contains a thorough explanation of the contract, its use cases, and
    its functionality.

2.  **Code Standards:** Please ensure that the submitted code is
    well-documented and adheres to the standard code conventions of
    Starknet. This will facilitate the review process and enhance the
    readability and comprehensibility of the contract.

3.  **Detailed Explanation:** Accompany your code with a detailed
    explanation of the contract logic. Wherever possible, use diagrams,
    flowcharts, or pseudocode to illustrate complex mechanisms or
    workflows.

As we expand this repertoire of contract examples, we hope to equip the
Starknet community with a robust toolset and inspire further exploration
and innovation in the realm of custom account contracts.
