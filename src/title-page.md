# The Starknet Book

The Starknet Book is a work in progress, shaped by ongoing community
input. Some sections may be incomplete or still under review and are
marked under a ðŸš§ emoji. We welcome your suggestions, feedback, and
content contributions to make this book a reliable guide for everyone.

The Starknet Book is a step-by-step guide aimed at teaching you the
essentials of Starknet development. Itâ€™s a community effort, with each
chapter guiding you through the Starknet ecosystem.

Understanding Cairo, the key programming language for Starknet smart
contracts, is crucial. Thatâ€™s why this book works hand-in-hand with the
Cairo Book, another community resource. You can access the Cairo Book
[**here**](https://book.cairo-lang.org/).

In short, the Cairo Book helps you master Cairo, while The Starknet Book
focuses on Starknetâ€™s specific features. For a well-rounded
understanding, we recommend exploring both. This book will introduce you
to tools, architecture, account setups, STARKs, and Starknet-specific
apps.

# Where to Start?

Depending on your goals and interests, you can choose different paths
through the Starknet Book. Here are some recommendations based on
various objectives:

- If youâ€™re a **complete beginner** and want to start learning about
  Cairo and Starknet from scratch, follow the book in its entirety,
  starting with **Introduction to Starknet**.

- If youâ€™re an **experienced developer** looking to quickly dive into
  writing scalable and decentralized smart contracts, focus on the
  Cairo Book, particularly **chapter 12: Starknet Smart Contracts**
  ([link](https://book.cairo-lang.org/ch13-00-introduction-to-starknet-smart-contracts.html)).

- If youâ€™re a **frontend developer** wanting to integrate Starknet
  with a React frontend using Javascript, prioritize the
  **starknet-js** and **starknet-react** subchapters in **Starknet
  Tooling**

- If youâ€™re a **DevOps engineer** or **node operator** interested in
  running a Starknet node and indexer, head straight to **Starknet
  Architecture**.

- If youâ€™re a **security researcher** or **smart contract auditor**
  wanting to learn about the Account Abstraction feature and its
  implications, go for **Account Abstraction**.

- If youâ€™re a **blockchain enthusiast** curious about the underlying
  architecture and mechanics of Starknet and Cairo, explore **Starknet
  Architecture**.

- If youâ€™re a **cryptography expert** or **researcher** eager to
  understand the fundamentals of STARKs and their connection to the
  Starknet ecosystem, delve into **STARKs**.

Feel free to mix and match these paths based on your unique interests
and requirements.
