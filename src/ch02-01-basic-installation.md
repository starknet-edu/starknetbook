# Installation

This chapter walks you through setting up your Starknet development
tools.

Essential tools to install:

1.  [Starkli](https://github.com/xJonathanLEI/starkli) - A CLI tool for
    interacting with Starknet. More tools are discussed in Chapter 2.

2.  [Scarb](https://github.com/software-mansion/scarb) - Cairoâ€™s package
    manager that compiles code to Sierra, a mid-level language between
    Cairo and CASM.

3.  [Katana](https://github.com/dojoengine/dojo) - Katana is a Starknet node, built for local development.

## Starkli Installation

Easily install Starkli using Starkliup, an installer invoked through the
command line.

```bash
curl https://get.starkli.sh | sh
starkliup
```

Restart your terminal and confirm installation:

```bash
starkli --version
```

To upgrade Starkli, simply repeat the steps.

## Scarb Package Manager Installation

We will get deeper into Scarb later in this chapter. For now, we will go over the installation process.

For macOS and Linux:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb/install.sh | sh
```

For Windows, follow manual setup in the [Scarb
documentation](https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb/download.html#windows).

Restart the terminal and run:

```bash
scarb --version
```

To upgrade Scarb, rerun the installation command.

## Katana Node Installation

To install Katana, use the `dojoup` installer from the command line:

```bash
curl -L https://install.dojoengine.org | bash
dojoup
```

After restarting your terminal, verify the installation with:

```bash
katana --version
```

To upgrade Katana, rerun the installation command.

You are now set to code in Cairo and deploy to Starknet.
