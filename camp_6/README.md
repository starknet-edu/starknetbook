    <h2 id="modular_arithmetic">Modular Arithmetic</h2>
    <p>A system of arithmetic for integers where numbers "wrap around" when reaching a certain value (aka 'modulus')</p>

</div>

A real-world example of modular arithmetic is time-keeping via a clock. When the hour of the day exceed the modulus(12) we "wrap" around and begin at zero.

Example:

```bash
python3 finite_fields/python/modular_arithmetic.py
```

<h2 align="center" id="finite_fields">Finite Fields</h2>

Much of today's practical cryptography is based on `finite fields`. A finite field is a field that contains a finite number of elements and defines arithmetic operations for multiplication, addition, subtraction, and divsion. These arithmetic operations are.

A finite field cannot contain sub-fields and therefore typically implements the principles of modular arithmetic over a large, irreducible prime number. The number of elements in the field is also known as its `order`.

Example:

```bash
python3 finite_fields/python/finite_field_arithmetic.py
```

<h2 align="center" id="polynomials">Polynomials</h2>

`Polynomials` have properties that are very useful in [ZK proofs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAaSQfZ-2AM). A polynomial is an expression of more than two algebraic terms. The degree of a polynomial is the highest degree of any specific term.

For an example of how Polynomials can be built and expressed in code run:

```bash
python3 finite_fields/python/polynomial.py
```

Zero Knowledge Proof Systems are proof systems in which there is secret information known to the `prover` that is not known to the `verifier`, and the verifier is still convinced of the computational claim.

A `non-interactive` proof system is an abstract machine that models computation between the two parties(prover and verifier). Messages are sent in [one direction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJO3ROT-A4E) until the verifier is convinced of the computational claim.

A `succinct` proof system is one in which the verifier can run an order of magnitute faster than a naive re-execution of the program

`SNARKS`: Succint Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge

`STARKs`: Scalable Transparent Arguments of Knowled

<h2 align="center" id="computational_integrity">Computational Integrity</h2>

The goal of these proof systems is to prove `computational integrity` to a verifier. Computational Integrity can be formalized as follow:

***Statement of Computational Integrity = (S0, P, T, S1)***

`S0`: Initial State
`P`: Program that changes state
`T`: Number of steps
`S1`: Final State

`UNDER CONSTRUCTION`:

While this section is being built we recommend reading this blog post series([1](https://medium.com/starkware/stark-math-the-journey-begins-51bd2b063c71), [2](https://medium.com/starkware/arithmetization-i-15c046390862), [3](https://medium.com/starkware/arithmetization-ii-403c3b3f4355)) on the math behind STARKs.
