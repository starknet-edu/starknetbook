        So you've landed in a strange finite field. Only thing to do now is setup basecamp.

### Overview

Basecamp is a curriculum built to teach the fundamental building blocks of the Cairo programming language and StarkNet development. It is divided by Camps. Finish the curriculum and you will be conquer the Ethereum world.

### Where to start?

Everybody has different goals in their Cairo and StarkNet journey. Follow this guide to continue trough the Basecamp; do you...

* ...want to set up your environement? [Go here](./camp_1/README.md#setup)
* ...want to start coding scalable and descentralized smart contracts right away? **Camps 1 and 2**.
* ...have a hackathon next week? **Camps 1 and 2**.
* ...want to go deeper into StarkNet's power? **Go on to Camps 3 - 4**.
* ...want to explore how STARKs and Cairo are created? **Go on to camps 5 - 6**.
